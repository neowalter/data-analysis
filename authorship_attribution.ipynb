to me that it had been many years since the world\\nhad been afforded the spectacle of a man adventurous enough to undertake\\na journey through Europe on foot. After much thought, I decided that\\nI was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle. So I\\ndetermined to do it. This was in March, 1878.\\n\\nI looked about me for the right sort of person to accompany me in the\\ncapacity of agent, and finally hired a Mr. Harris for this service.\\n\\nIt was also my purpose to study art while in Europe. Mr. Harris was in\\nsympathy with me in this. He was as much of an enthusiast in art as\\nI was, and not less anxious to learn to paint. I desired to learn the\\nGerman language; so did Harris.\\n\\nToward the middle of April we sailed in the _Holsatia_, Captain Brandt,\\nand had a very pleasant trip, indeed.\\n\\nAfter a brief rest at Hamburg, we made preparations for a long\\npedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather, but at the\\nlast moment we changed the program, for private reasons, and took the\\nexpress-train.\\n\\nWe made a short halt at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and found it an\\ninteresting city. I would have liked to visit the birthplace of\\nGutenburg, but it could not be done, as no memorandum of the site of the\\nhouse has been kept. So we spent an hour in the Goethe mansion instead.\\nThe city permits this house to belong to private parties, instead\\nof gracing and dignifying herself with the honor of possessing and\\nprotecting it.\\n\\nFrankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have the distinction of\\nbeing the place where the following incident occurred. Charlemagne,\\nwhile chasing the Saxons (as _he_ said), or being chased by them (as\\n_they_ said), arrived at the bank of the river at dawn, in a fog. The\\nenemy were either before him or behind him; but in any case he wanted\\nto get across, very badly. He would have given anything for a guide,\\nbut none was to be had. Presently he saw a deer, followed by her young,\\napproach the water. He watched her, judging that she would seek a ford,\\nand he was right. She waded over, and the army followed. So a great\\nFrankish victory or defeat was gained or avoided; and in order to\\ncommemorate the episode, Charlemagne commanded a city to be built there,\\nwhich he named Frankfort--the ford of the Franks. None of the other\\ncities where this event happened were named for it. This is good\\nevidence that Frankfort was the first place it occurred at.\\n\\nFrankfort has another distinction--it is the birthplace of the German\\nalphabet; or at least of the German word for alphabet--_buchstaben_.\\nThey say that the first movable types were made on birch\\nsticks--_buchstabe_--hence the name.\\n\\nI was taught a lesson in political economy in Frankfort. I had brought\\nfrom home a box containing a thousand very cheap cigars. By way of\\nexperiment, I stepped into a little shop in a queer old back street,\\ntook four gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars, and\\nlaid down a silver piece worth 48 cents. The man gave me 43 cents\\nchange.\\n\\nIn Frankfort everybody wears clean clothes, and I think we noticed that\\nthis strange thing was the case in Hamburg, too, and in the villages\\nalong the road. Even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient\\nquarters of Frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule. The little\\nchildren of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into a\\nbody\\'s lap. And as for the uniforms of the soldiers, they were newness\\nand brightness carried to perfection. One could never detect a smirch\\nor a grain of dust upon them. The street-car conductors and drivers wore\\npretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the bandbox, and their\\nmanners were as fine as their clothes.\\n\\nIn one of the shops I had the luck to stumble upon a book which has\\ncharmed me nearly to death. It is entitled _The Legends Of The Rhine\\nFrom Basle To Rotterdam_, by F. J. Kiefer; translated by L. W. Garnham,\\nB.A.\\n\\nAll tourists _mention_ the Rhine legends--in that sort of way which\\nquietly pretends that the mentioner has been familiar with them all his\\nlife, and that the reader cannot possibly be ignorant of them--but no\\ntourist ever _tells_ them. So this little book fed me in a very hungry\\nplace; and I, in my turn, intend to feed my reader, with one or\\ntwo little lunches from the same larder. I shall not mar Garnham\\'s\\ntranslation by meddling with its English; for the most toothsome thing\\nabout it is its quaint fashion of building English sentences on the\\nGerman plan--and punctuating them accordingly to no plan at all.\\n\\nIn the chapter devoted to \"Legends of Frankfort,\" I find the following:\\n\\n\"THE KNAVE OF BERGEN\"\\n\\n\"In Frankfort at the Romer was a great mask-ball, at the coronation\\nfestival, and in the illuminated saloon, the clanging music invited\\nto dance, and splendidly appeared the rich toilets and charms of the\\nladies, and the festively costumed Princes and Knights. All seemed\\npleasure, joy, and roguish gaiety, only one of the numerous guests had\\na gloomy exterior; but exactly the black armor in which he walked about\\nexcited general attention, and his tall figure, as well as the noble\\npropriety of his movements, attracted especially the regards of the\\nladies.\\n\\nWho the Knight was? Nobody could guess, for his Vizier was well closed,\\nand nothing made him recognizable. Proud and yet modest he advanced to\\nthe Empress; bowed on one knee before her seat, and begged for the favor\\nof a waltz with the Queen of the festival. And she allowed his request.\\nWith light and graceful steps he danced through the long saloon, with\\nthe sovereign who thought never to have found a more dexterous and\\nexcellent dancer. But also by the grace of his manner, and fine\\nconversation he knew to win the Queen, and she graciously accorded him\\na second dance for which he begged, a third, and a fourth, as well as\\nothers were not refused him. How all regarded the happy dancer, how\\nmany envied him the high favor; how increased curiosity, who the masked\\nknight could be.\\n\\n\"Also the Emperor became more and more excited with curiosity, and with\\ngreat suspense one awaited the hour, when according to mask-law, each\\nmasked guest must make himself known. This moment came, but although all\\nother unmasked; the secret knight still refused to allow his features\\nto be seen, till at last the Queen driven by curiosity, and vexed at the\\nobstinate refusal; commanded him to open his Vizier.\\n\\nHe opened it, and none of the high ladies and knights knew him. But from\\nthe crowded spectators, 2 officials advanced, who recognized the black\\ndancer, and horror and terror spread in the saloon, as they said who the\\nsupposed knight was. It was the executioner of Bergen. But glowing with\\nrage, the King commanded to seize the criminal and lead him to death,\\nwho had ventured to dance, with the queen; so disgraced the Empress,\\nand insulted the crown. The culpable threw himself at the Emperor, and\\nsaid--\\n\\n\"\\'Indeed I have heavily sinned against all noble guests assembled here,\\nbut most heavily against you my sovereign and my queen. The Queen is\\ninsulted by my haughtiness equal to treason, but no punishment even\\nblood, will not be able to wash out the disgrace, which you have\\nsuffered by me. Therefore oh King! allow me to propose a remedy, to\\nefface the shame, and to render it as if not done. Draw your sword and\\nknight me, then I will throw down my gauntlet, to everyone who dares to\\nspeak disrespectfully of my king.\\'\\n\\n\"The Emperor was surprised at this bold proposal, however it appeared\\nthe wisest to him; \\'You are a knave,\\' he replied after a moment\\'s\\nconsideration, \\'however your advice is good, and displays prudence, as\\nyour offense shows adventurous courage. Well then,\\' and gave him the\\nknight-stroke \\'so I raise you to nobility, who begged for grace for your\\noffense now kneels before me, rise as knight; knavish you have acted,\\nand Knave of Bergen shall you be called henceforth,\\' and gladly the\\nBlack knight rose; three cheers were given in honor of the Emperor, and\\nloud cries of joy testified the approbation with which the Queen danced\\nstill once with the Knave of Bergen.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER II\\n\\nHeidelberg\\n\\n[Landing a Monarch at Heidelberg]\\n\\nWe stopped at a hotel by the railway-station. Next morning, as we sat in\\nmy room waiting for breakfast to come up, we got a good deal interested\\nin something which was going on over the way, in front of another\\nhotel. First, the personage who is called the _Portier_ (who is not the\\n_Porter_, but is a sort of first-mate of a hotel) [1. See Appendix\\nA] appeared at the door in a spick-and-span new blue cloth uniform,\\ndecorated with shining brass buttons, and with bands of gold lace around\\nhis cap and wristbands; and he wore white gloves, too.\\n\\nHe shed an official glance upon the situation, and then began to give\\norders. Two women-servants came out with pails and brooms and brushes,\\nand gave the sidewalk a thorough scrubbing; meanwhile two others\\nscrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door; beyond these we\\ncould see some men-servants taking up the carpet of the grand staircase.\\nThis carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and\\nbanged and swept out of it; then brought back and put down again. The\\nbrass stair-rods received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to\\ntheir places. Now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming\\nplants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the\\nbase of the staircase. Other servants adorned all the balconies of the\\nvarious stories with flowers and banners; others ascended to the\\nroof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there. Now came some more\\nchamber-maids and retouched the sidewalk, and afterward wiped the marble\\nsteps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather\\nbrushes. Now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the\\nmarble steps and out across the sidewalk to the curbstone. The _Portier_\\ncast his eye along it, and found it was not absolutely straight; he\\ncommanded it to be straightened; the servants made the effort--made\\nseveral efforts, in fact--but the _Portier_ was not satisfied. He\\nfinally had it taken up, and then he put it down himself and got it\\nright.\\n\\nAt this stage of the proceedings, a narrow bright red carpet was\\nunrolled and stretched from the top of the marble steps to the\\ncurbstone, along the center of the black carpet. This red path cost\\nthe _Portier_ more trouble than even the black one had done. But he\\npatiently fixed and refixed it until it was exactly right and lay\\nprecisely in the middle of the black carpet. In New York these\\nperformances would have gathered a mighty crowd of curious and intensely\\ninterested spectators; but here it only captured an audience of half\\na dozen little boys who stood in a row across the pavement, some with\\ntheir school-knapsacks on their backs and their hands in their pockets,\\nothers with arms full of bundles, and all absorbed in the show.\\nOccasionally one of them skipped irreverently over the carpet and\\ntook up a position on the other side. This always visibly annoyed the\\n_Portier_.\\n\\nNow came a waiting interval. The landlord, in plain clothes, and\\nbareheaded, placed himself on the bottom marble step, abreast the\\n_Portier_, who stood on the other end of the same steps; six or eight\\nwaiters, gloved, bareheaded, and wearing their whitest linen, their\\nwhitest cravats, and their finest swallow-tails, grouped themselves\\nabout these chiefs, but leaving the carpetway clear. Nobody moved or\\nspoke any more but only waited.\\n\\nIn a short time the shrill piping of a coming train was heard, and\\nimmediately groups of people began to gather in the street. Two or three\\nopen carriages arrived, and deposited some maids of honor and some male\\nofficials at the hotel. Presently another open carriage brought the\\nGrand Duke of Baden, a stately man in uniform, who wore the handsome\\nbrass-mounted, steel-spiked helmet of the army on his head. Last came\\nthe Empress of Germany and the Grand Duchess of Baden in a closed\\ncarriage; these passed through the low-bowing groups of servants and\\ndisappeared in the hotel, exhibiting to us only the backs of their\\nheads, and then the show was over.\\n\\nIt appears to be as difficult to land a monarch as it is to launch a\\nship.\\n\\nBut as to Heidelberg. The weather was growing pretty warm,--very warm,\\nin fact. So we left the valley and took quarters at the Schloss Hotel,\\non the hill, above the Castle.\\n\\nHeidelberg lies at the mouth of a narrow gorge--a gorge the shape of\\na shepherd\\'s crook; if one looks up it he perceives that it is about\\nstraight, for a mile and a half, then makes a sharp curve to the\\nright and disappears. This gorge--along whose bottom pours the swift\\nNeckar--is confined between (or cloven through) a couple of long, steep\\nridges, a thousand feet high and densely wooded clear to their summits,\\nwith the exception of one section which has been shaved and put under\\ncultivation. These ridges are chopped off at the mouth of the gorge\\nand form two bold and conspicuous headlands, with Heidelberg nestling\\nbetween them; from their bases spreads away the vast dim expanse of the\\nRhine valley, and into this expanse the Neckar goes wandering in shining\\ncurves and is presently lost to view.\\n\\nNow if one turns and looks up the gorge once more, he will see the\\nSchloss Hotel on the right perched on a precipice overlooking the\\nNeckar--a precipice which is so sumptuously cushioned and draped with\\nfoliage that no glimpse of the rock appears. The building seems very\\nairily situated. It has the appearance of being on a shelf half-way\\nup the wooded mountainside; and as it is remote and isolated, and very\\nwhite, it makes a strong mark against the lofty leafy rampart at its\\nback.\\n\\nThis hotel had a feature which was a decided novelty, and one which\\nmight be adopted with advantage by any house which is perched in a\\ncommanding situation. This feature may be described as a series of\\nglass-enclosed parlors _clinging to the outside of the house_, one\\nagainst each and every bed-chamber and drawing-room. They are like long,\\nnarrow, high-ceiled bird-cages hung against the building. My room was a\\ncorner room, and had two of these things, a north one and a west one.\\n\\nFrom the north cage one looks up the Neckar gorge; from the west one he\\nlooks down it. This last affords the most extensive view, and it is one\\nof the loveliest that can be imagined, too. Out of a billowy upheaval\\nof vivid green foliage, a rifle-shot removed, rises the huge ruin\\nof Heidelberg Castle, [2. See Appendix B] with empty window arches,\\nivy-mailed battlements, moldering towers--the Lear of inanimate\\nnature--deserted, discrowned, beaten by the storms, but royal still,\\nand beautiful. It is a fine sight to see the evening sunlight suddenly\\nstrike the leafy declivity at the Castle\\'s base and dash up it and\\ndrench it as with a luminous spray, while the adjacent groves are in\\ndeep shadow.\\n\\nBehind the Castle swells a great dome-shaped hill, forest-clad, and\\nbeyond that a nobler and loftier one. The Castle looks down upon the\\ncompact brown-roofed town; and from the town two picturesque old bridges\\nspan the river. Now the view broadens; through the gateway of the\\nsentinel headlands you gaze out over the wide Rhine plain, which\\nstretches away, softly and richly tinted, grows gradually and dreamily\\nindistinct, and finally melts imperceptibly into the remote horizon.\\n\\nI have never enjoyed a view which had such a serene and satisfying charm\\nabout it as this one gives.\\n\\nThe first night we were there, we went to bed and to sleep early; but\\nI awoke at the end of two or three hours, and lay a comfortable while\\nlistening to the soothing patter of the rain against the balcony\\nwindows. I took it to be rain, but it turned out to be only the murmur\\nof the restless Neckar, tumbling over her dikes and dams far below, in\\nthe gorge. I got up and went into the west balcony and saw a wonderful\\nsight. Away down on the level under the black mass of the Castle, the\\ntown lay, stretched along the river, its intricate cobweb of streets\\njeweled with twinkling lights; there were rows of lights on the bridges;\\nthese flung lances of light upon the water, in the black shadows of the\\narches; and away at the extremity of all this fairy spectacle blinked\\nand glowed a massed multitude of gas-jets which seemed to cover acres of\\nground; it was as if all the diamonds in the world had been spread\\nout there. I did not know before, that a half-mile of sextuple\\nrailway-tracks could be made such an adornment.\\n\\nOne thinks Heidelberg by day--with its surroundings--is the last\\npossibility of the beautiful; but when he sees Heidelberg by night, a\\nfallen Milky Way, with that glittering railway constellation pinned to\\nthe border, he requires time to consider upon the verdict.\\n\\nOne never tires of poking about in the dense woods that clothe all these\\nlofty Neckar hills to their tops. The great deeps of a boundless forest\\nhave a beguiling and impressive charm in any country; but German legends\\nand fairy tales have given these an added charm. They have peopled all\\nthat region with gnomes, and dwarfs, and all sorts of mysterious and\\nuncanny creatures. At the time I am writing of, I had been reading\\nso much of this literature that sometimes I was not sure but I was\\nbeginning to believe in the gnomes and fairies as realities.\\n\\nOne afternoon I got lost in the woods about a mile from the hotel, and\\npresently fell into a train of dreamy thought about animals which talk,\\nand kobolds, and enchanted folk, and the rest of the pleasant legendary\\nstuff; and so, by stimulating my fancy, I finally got to imagining I\\nglimpsed small flitting shapes here and there down the columned\\naisles of the forest. It was a place which was peculiarly meet for the\\noccasion. It was a pine wood, with so thick and soft a carpet of brown\\nneedles that one\\'s footfall made no more sound than if he were treading\\non wool; the tree-trunks were as round and straight and smooth as\\npillars, and stood close together; they were bare of branches to a point\\nabout twenty-five feet above-ground, and from there upward so thick with\\nboughs that not a ray of sunlight could pierce through. The world was\\nbright with sunshine outside, but a deep and mellow twilight reigned in\\nthere, and also a deep silence so profound that I seemed to hear my own\\nbreathings.\\n\\nWhen I had stood ten minutes, thinking and imagining, and getting\\nmy spirit in tune with the place, and in the right mood to enjoy the\\nsupernatural, a raven suddenly uttered a horse croak over my head. It\\nmade me start; and then I was angry because I started. I looked up, and\\nthe creature was sitting on a limb right over me, looking down at me.\\nI felt something of the same sense of humiliation and injury which\\none feels when he finds that a human stranger has been clandestinely\\ninspecting him in his privacy and mentally commenting upon him. I eyed\\nthe raven, and the raven eyed me. Nothing was said during some seconds.\\nThen the bird stepped a little way along his limb to get a better point\\nof observation, lifted his wings, stuck his head far down below his\\nshoulders toward me and croaked again--a croak with a distinctly\\ninsulting expression about it. If he had spoken in English he could\\nnot have said any more plainly than he did say in raven, \"Well, what do\\n_you_ want here?\" I felt as foolish as if I had been caught in some\\nmean act by a responsible being, and reproved for it. However, I made\\nno reply; I would not bandy words with a raven. The adversary waited\\na while, with his shoulders still lifted, his head thrust down between\\nthem, and his keen bright eye fixed on me; then he threw out two or\\nthree more insults, which I could not understand, further than that I\\nknew a portion of them consisted of language not used in church.\\n\\nI still made no reply. Now the adversary raised his head and\\ncalled. There was an answering croak from a little distance in the\\nwood--evidently a croak of inquiry. The adversary explained with\\nenthusiasm, and the other raven dropped everything and came. The two sat\\nside by side on the limb and discussed me as freely and offensively as\\ntwo great naturalists might discuss a new kind of bug. The thing became\\nmore and more embarrassing. They called in another friend. This was too\\nmuch. I saw that they had the advantage of me, and so I concluded to get\\nout of the scrape by walking out of it. They enjoyed my defeat as much\\nas any low white people could have done. They craned their necks and\\nlaughed at me (for a raven _can_ laugh, just like a man), they squalled\\ninsulting remarks after me as long as they could see me. They were\\nnothing but ravens--I knew that--what they thought of me could be a\\nmatter of no consequence--and yet when even a raven shouts after you,\\n\"What a hat!\" \"Oh, pull down your vest!\" and that sort of thing, it\\nhurts you and humiliates you, and there is no getting around it with\\nfine reasoning and pretty arguments.\\n\\nAnimals talk to each other, of course. There can be no question about\\nthat; but I suppose there are very few people who can understand them.\\nI never knew but one man who could. I knew he could, however, because he\\ntold me so himself. He was a middle-aged, simple-hearted miner who had\\nlived in a lonely corner of California, among the woods and mountains,\\na good many years, and had studied the ways of his only neighbors, the\\nbeasts and the birds, until he believed he could accurately translate\\nany remark which they made. This was Jim Baker. According to Jim Baker,\\nsome animals have only a limited education, and some use only simple\\nwords, and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure; whereas,\\ncertain other animals have a large vocabulary, a fine command of\\nlanguage and a ready and fluent delivery; consequently these latter talk\\na great deal; they like it; they are so conscious of their talent,\\nand they enjoy \"showing off.\" Baker said, that after long and careful\\nobservation, he had come to the conclusion that the bluejays were the\\nbest talkers he had found among birds and beasts. Said he:\\n\\n\"There\\'s more _to_ a bluejay than any other creature. He has got more\\nmoods, and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures; and,\\nmind you, whatever a bluejay feels, he can put into language. And\\nno mere commonplace language, either, but rattling, out-and-out\\nbook-talk--and bristling with metaphor, too--just bristling! And as for\\ncommand of language--why _you_ never see a bluejay get stuck for a word.\\nNo man ever did. They just boil out of him! And another thing: I\\'ve\\nnoticed a good deal, and there\\'s no bird, or cow, or anything that uses\\nas good grammar as a bluejay. You may say a cat uses good grammar. Well,\\na cat does--but you let a cat get excited once; you let a cat get to\\npulling fur with another cat on a shed, nights, and you\\'ll hear grammar\\nthat will give you the lockjaw. Ignorant people think it\\'s the _noise_\\nwhich fighting cats make that is so aggravating, but it ain\\'t so; it\\'s\\nthe sickening grammar they use. Now I\\'ve never heard a jay use bad\\ngrammar but very seldom; and when they do, they are as ashamed as a\\nhuman; they shut right down and leave.\\n\\n\"You may call a jay a bird. Well, so he is, in a measure--but he\\'s got\\nfeathers on him, and don\\'t belong to no church, perhaps; but otherwise\\nhe is just as much human as you be. And I\\'ll tell you for why. A jay\\'s\\ngifts, and instincts, and feelings, and interests, cover the whole\\nground. A jay hasn\\'t got any more principle than a Congressman. A jay\\nwill lie, a jay will steal, a jay will deceive, a jay will betray; and\\nfour times out of five, a jay will go back on his solemnest promise. The\\nsacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you can\\'t cram into\\nno bluejay\\'s head. Now, on top of all this, there\\'s another thing; a\\njay can out-swear any gentleman in the mines. You think a cat can swear.\\nWell, a cat can; but you give a bluejay a subject that calls for his\\nreserve-powers, and where is your cat? Don\\'t talk to _me_--I know too\\nmuch about this thing; in the one little particular of scolding--just\\ngood, clean, out-and-out scolding--a bluejay can lay over anything,\\nhuman or divine. Yes, sir, a jay is everything that a man is. A jay can\\ncry, a jay can laugh, a jay can feel shame, a jay can reason and plan\\nand discuss, a jay likes gossip and scandal, a jay has got a sense\\nof humor, a jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you do--maybe\\nbetter. If a jay ain\\'t human, he better take in his sign, that\\'s all.\\nNow I\\'m going to tell you a perfectly true fact about some bluejays.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nBaker\\'s Bluejay Yarn\\n\\n[What Stumped the Blue Jays]\\n\\n\"When I first begun to understand jay language correctly, there was a\\nlittle incident happened here. Seven years ago, the last man in this\\nregion but me moved away. There stands his house--been empty ever since;\\na log house, with a plank roof--just one big room, and no more; no\\nceiling--nothing between the rafters and the floor. Well, one Sunday\\nmorning I was sitting out here in front of my cabin, with my cat, taking\\nthe sun, and looking at the blue hills, and listening to the leaves\\nrustling so lonely in the trees, and thinking of the home away yonder in\\nthe states, that I hadn\\'t heard from in thirteen years, when a bluejay\\nlit on that house, with an acorn in his mouth, and says, \\'Hello, I\\nreckon I\\'ve struck something.\\' When he spoke, the acorn dropped out of\\nhis mouth and rolled down the roof, of course, but he didn\\'t care; his\\nmind was all on the thing he had struck. It was a knot-hole in the roof.\\nHe cocked his head to one side, shut one eye and put the other one to\\nthe hole, like a possum looking down a jug; then he glanced up with\\nhis bright eyes, gave a wink or two with his wings--which signifies\\ngratification, you understand--and says, \\'It looks like a hole, it\\'s\\nlocated like a hole--blamed if I don\\'t believe it _is_ a hole!\\'\\n\\n\"Then he cocked his head down and took another look; he glances up\\nperfectly joyful, this time; winks his wings and his tail both, and\\nsays, \\'Oh, no, this ain\\'t no fat thing, I reckon! If I ain\\'t in luck!\\n--Why it\\'s a perfectly elegant hole!\\' So he flew down and got that\\nacorn, and fetched it up and dropped it in, and was just tilting his\\nhead back, with the heavenliest smile on his face, when all of a\\nsudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded\\ngradually out of his countenance like breath off\\'n a razor, and the\\nqueerest look of surprise took its place. Then he says, \\'Why, I didn\\'t\\nhear it fall!\\' He cocked his eye at the hole again, and took a long\\nlook; raised up and shook his head; stepped around to the other side of\\nthe hole and took another look from that side; shook his head again. He\\nstudied a while, then he just went into the Details--walked round and\\nround the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass.\\nNo use. Now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and\\nscratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute, and finally\\nsays, \\'Well, it\\'s too many for _me_, that\\'s certain; must be a mighty\\nlong hole; however, I ain\\'t got no time to fool around here, I got to\\n\"tend to business\"; I reckon it\\'s all right--chance it, anyway.\\'\\n\\n\"So he flew off and fetched another acorn and dropped it in, and tried\\nto flirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it,\\nbut he was too late. He held his eye there as much as a minute; then he\\nraised up and sighed, and says, \\'Confound it, I don\\'t seem to understand\\nthis thing, no way; however, I\\'ll tackle her again.\\' He fetched\\nanother acorn, and done his level best to see what become of it, but he\\ncouldn\\'t. He says, \\'Well, I never struck no such a hole as this before;\\nI\\'m of the opinion it\\'s a totally new kind of a hole.\\' Then he begun\\nto get mad. He held in for a spell, walking up and down the comb of the\\nroof and shaking his head and muttering to himself; but his feelings got\\nthe upper hand of him, presently, and he broke loose and cussed himself\\nblack in the face. I never see a bird take on so about a little thing.\\nWhen he got through he walks to the hole and looks in again for half a\\nminute; then he says, \\'Well, you\\'re a long hole, and a deep hole, and\\na mighty singular hole altogether--but I\\'ve started in to fill you, and\\nI\\'m damned if I _don\\'t_ fill you, if it takes a hundred years!\\'\\n\\n\"And with that, away he went. You never see a bird work so since you was\\nborn. He laid into his work like a nigger, and the way he hove acorns\\ninto that hole for about two hours and a half was one of the most\\nexciting and astonishing spectacles I ever struck. He never stopped to\\ntake a look anymore--he just hove \\'em in and went for more. Well, at\\nlast he could hardly flop his wings, he was so tuckered out. He comes\\na-dropping down, once more, sweating like an ice-pitcher, dropped his\\nacorn in and says, \\'_Now_ I guess I\\'ve got the bulge on you by this\\ntime!\\' So he bent down for a look. If you\\'ll believe me, when his head\\ncome up again he was just pale with rage. He says, \\'I\\'ve shoveled acorns\\nenough in there to keep the family thirty years, and if I can see a sign\\nof one of \\'em I wish I may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust\\nin two minutes!\\'\\n\\n\"He just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and lean his\\nback agin the chimbly, and then he collected his impressions and\\nbegun to free his mind. I see in a second that what I had mistook for\\nprofanity in the mines was only just the rudiments, as you may say.\\n\\n\"Another jay was going by, and heard him doing his devotions, and stops\\nto inquire what was up. The sufferer told him the whole circumstance,\\nand says, \\'Now yonder\\'s the hole, and if you don\\'t believe me, go and\\nlook for yourself.\\' So this fellow went and looked, and comes back and\\nsays, \\'How many did you say you put in there?\\' \\'Not any less than\\ntwo tons,\\' says the sufferer. The other jay went and looked again. He\\ncouldn\\'t seem to make it out, so he raised a yell, and three more jays\\ncome. They all examined the hole, they all made the sufferer tell\\nit over again, then they all discussed it, and got off as many\\nleather-headed opinions about it as an average crowd of humans could\\nhave done.\\n\\n\"They called in more jays; then more and more, till pretty soon this\\nwhole region \\'peared to have a blue flush about it. There must have been\\nfive thousand of them; and such another jawing and disputing and ripping\\nand cussing, you never heard. Every jay in the whole lot put his eye to\\nthe hole and delivered a more chuckle-headed opinion about the mystery\\nthan the jay that went there before him. They examined the house all\\nover, too. The door was standing half open, and at last one old jay\\nhappened to go and light on it and look in. Of course, that knocked the\\nmystery galley-west in a second. There lay the acorns, scattered all\\nover the floor.. He flopped his wings and raised a whoop. \\'Come here!\\'\\nhe says, \\'Come here, everybody; hang\\'d if this fool hasn\\'t been trying\\nto fill up a house with acorns!\\' They all came a-swooping down like a\\nblue cloud, and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance, the\\nwhole absurdity of the contract that that first jay had tackled hit him\\nhome and he fell over backward suffocating with laughter, and the next\\njay took his place and done the same.\\n\\n\"Well, sir, they roosted around here on the housetop and the trees for\\nan hour, and guffawed over that thing like human beings. It ain\\'t any\\nuse to tell me a bluejay hasn\\'t got a sense of humor, because I know\\nbetter. And memory, too. They brought jays here from all over the United\\nStates to look down that hole, every summer for three years. Other\\nbirds, too. And they could all see the point except an owl that come\\nfrom Nova Scotia to visit the Yo Semite, and he took this thing in on\\nhis way back. He said he couldn\\'t see anything funny in it. But then he\\nwas a good deal disappointed about Yo Semite, too.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nStudent Life\\n\\n[The Laborious Beer King]\\n\\nThe summer semester was in full tide; consequently the most frequent\\nfigure in and about Heidelberg was the student. Most of the students\\nwere Germans, of course, but the representatives of foreign lands\\nwere very numerous. They hailed from every corner of the globe--for\\ninstruction is cheap in Heidelberg, and so is living, too. The\\nAnglo-American Club, composed of British and American students, had\\ntwenty-five members, and there was still much material left to draw\\nfrom.\\n\\nNine-tenths of the Heidelberg students wore no badge or uniform;\\nthe other tenth wore caps of various colors, and belonged to social\\norganizations called \"corps.\" There were five corps, each with a color\\nof its own; there were white caps, blue caps, and red, yellow, and green\\nones. The famous duel-fighting is confined to the \"corps\" boys. The\\n\"_Kneip_\" seems to be a specialty of theirs, too. Kneips are held, now\\nand then, to celebrate great occasions, like the election of a beer\\nking, for instance. The solemnity is simple; the five corps assemble at\\nnight, and at a signal they all fall loading themselves with beer,\\nout of pint-mugs, as fast as possible, and each man keeps his own\\ncount--usually by laying aside a lucifer match for each mug he empties.\\n\\nThe election is soon decided. When the candidates can hold no more, a\\ncount is instituted and the one who has drank the greatest number of\\npints is proclaimed king. I was told that the last beer king elected\\nby the corps--or by his own capabilities--emptied his mug seventy-five\\ntimes. No stomach could hold all that quantity at one time, of\\ncourse--but there are ways of frequently creating a vacuum, which those\\nwho have been much at sea will understand.\\n\\nOne sees so many students abroad at all hours, that he presently begins\\nto wonder if they ever have any working-hours. Some of them have, some\\nof them haven\\'t. Each can choose for himself whether he will work or\\nplay; for German university life is a very free life; it seems to have\\nno restraints. The student does not live in the college buildings, but\\nhires his own lodgings, in any locality he prefers, and he takes his\\nmeals when and where he pleases. He goes to bed when it suits him, and\\ndoes not get up at all unless he wants to. He is not entered at the\\nuniversity for any particular length of time; so he is likely to change\\nabout. He passes no examinations upon entering college. He merely pays\\na trifling fee of five or ten dollars, receives a card entitling him to\\nthe privileges of the university, and that is the end of it. He is now\\nready for business--or play, as he shall prefer. If he elects to\\nwork, he finds a large list of lectures to choose from. He selects the\\nsubjects which he will study, and enters his name for these studies; but\\nhe can skip attendance.\\n\\nThe result of this system is, that lecture-courses upon specialties\\nof an unusual nature are often delivered to very slim audiences,\\nwhile those upon more practical and every-day matters of education are\\ndelivered to very large ones. I heard of one case where, day after day,\\nthe lecturer\\'s audience consisted of three students--and always the\\nsame three. But one day two of them remained away. The lecturer began as\\nusual--\\n\\n\"Gentlemen,\" --then, without a smile, he corrected himself, saying--\\n\\n\"Sir,\" --and went on with his discourse.\\n\\nIt is said that the vast majority of the Heidelberg students are hard\\nworkers, and make the most of their opportunities; that they have\\nno surplus means to spend in dissipation, and no time to spare for\\nfrolicking. One lecture follows right on the heels of another, with very\\nlittle time for the student to get out of one hall and into the next;\\nbut the industrious ones manage it by going on a trot. The professors\\nassist them in the saving of their time by being promptly in their\\nlittle boxed-up pulpits when the hours strike, and as promptly out again\\nwhen the hour finishes. I entered an empty lecture-room one day just\\nbefore the clock struck. The place had simple, unpainted pine desks and\\nbenches for about two hundred persons.\\n\\nAbout a minute before the clock struck, a hundred and fifty students\\nswarmed in, rushed to their seats, immediately spread open their\\nnotebooks and dipped their pens in ink. When the clock began to strike,\\na burly professor entered, was received with a round of applause, moved\\nswiftly down the center aisle, said \"Gentlemen,\" and began to talk as he\\nclimbed his pulpit steps; and by the time he had arrived in his box and\\nfaced his audience, his lecture was well under way and all the pens were\\ngoing. He had no notes, he talked with prodigious rapidity and\\nenergy for an hour--then the students began to remind him in certain\\nwell-understood ways that his time was up; he seized his hat, still\\ntalking, proceeded swiftly down his pulpit steps, got out the last word\\nof his discourse as he struck the floor; everybody rose respectfully,\\nand he swept rapidly down the aisle and disappeared. An instant rush for\\nsome other lecture-room followed, and in a minute I was alone with the\\nempty benches once more.\\n\\nYes, without doubt, idle students are not the rule. Out of eight hundred\\nin the town, I knew the faces of only about fifty; but these I saw\\neverywhere, and daily. They walked about the streets and the wooded\\nhills, they drove in cabs, they boated on the river, they sipped beer\\nand coffee, afternoons, in the Schloss gardens. A good many of them wore\\ncolored caps of the corps. They were finely and fashionably dressed,\\ntheir manners were quite superb, and they led an easy, careless,\\ncomfortable life. If a dozen of them sat together and a lady or a\\ngentleman passed whom one of them knew and saluted, they all rose\\nto their feet and took off their caps. The members of a corps always\\nreceived a fellow-member in this way, too; but they paid no attention\\nto members of other corps; they did not seem to see them. This was not\\na discourtesy; it was only a part of the elaborate and rigid corps\\netiquette.\\n\\nThere seems to be no chilly distance existing between the German\\nstudents and the professor; but, on the contrary, a companionable\\nintercourse, the opposite of chilliness and reserve. When the professor\\nenters a beer-hall in the evening where students are gathered together,\\nthese rise up and take off their caps, and invite the old gentleman to\\nsit with them and partake. He accepts, and the pleasant talk and the\\nbeer flow for an hour or two, and by and by the professor, properly\\ncharged and comfortable, gives a cordial good night, while the students\\nstand bowing and uncovered; and then he moves on his happy way homeward\\nwith all his vast cargo of learning afloat in his hold. Nobody finds\\nfault or feels outraged; no harm has been done.\\n\\nIt seemed to be a part of corps etiquette to keep a dog or so, too.\\nI mean a corps dog--the common property of the organization, like the\\ncorps steward or head servant; then there are other dogs, owned by\\nindividuals.\\n\\nOn a summer afternoon in the Castle gardens, I have seen six students\\nmarch solemnly into the grounds, in single file, each carrying a bright\\nChinese parasol and leading a prodigious dog by a string. It was a very\\nimposing spectacle. Sometimes there would be as many dogs around the\\npavilion as students; and of all breeds and of all degrees of beauty and\\nugliness. These dogs had a rather dry time of it; for they were tied\\nto the benches and had no amusement for an hour or two at a time except\\nwhat they could get out of pawing at the gnats, or trying to sleep and\\nnot succeeding. However, they got a lump of sugar occasionally--they\\nwere fond of that.\\n\\nIt seemed right and proper that students should indulge in dogs; but\\neverybody else had them, too--old men and young ones, old women and\\nnice young ladies. If there is one spectacle that is unpleasanter than\\nanother, it is that of an elegantly dressed young lady towing a dog by a\\nstring. It is said to be the sign and symbol of blighted love. It seems\\nto me that some other way of advertising it might be devised, which\\nwould be just as conspicuous and yet not so trying to the proprieties.\\n\\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that the easy-going pleasure-seeking\\nstudent carries an empty head. Just the contrary. He has spent nine\\nyears in the gymnasium, under a system which allowed him no freedom, but\\nvigorously compelled him to work like a slave. Consequently, he has left\\nthe gymnasium with an education which is so extensive and complete, that\\nthe most a university can do for it is to perfect some of its profounder\\nspecialties. It is said that when a pupil leaves the gymnasium, he not\\nonly has a comprehensive education, but he _knows_ what he knows--it\\nis not befogged with uncertainty, it is burnt into him so that it will\\nstay. For instance, he does not merely read and write Greek, but speaks\\nit; the same with the Latin. Foreign youth steer clear of the gymnasium;\\nits rules are too severe. They go to the university to put a mansard\\nroof on their whole general education; but the German student already\\nhas his mansard roof, so he goes there to add a steeple in the nature of\\nsome specialty, such as a particular branch of law, or diseases of the\\neye, or special study of the ancient Gothic tongues. So this German\\nattends only the lectures which belong to the chosen branch, and drinks\\nhis beer and tows his dog around and has a general good time the rest of\\nthe day. He has been in rigid bondage so long that the large liberty\\nof the university life is just what he needs and likes and thoroughly\\nappreciates; and as it cannot last forever, he makes the most of it\\nwhile it does last, and so lays up a good rest against the day that must\\nsee him put on the chains once more and enter the slavery of official or\\nprofessional life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nAt the Students\\' Dueling-Ground\\n\\n[Dueling by Wholesale]\\n\\nOne day in the interest of science my agent obtained permission to bring\\nme to the students\\' dueling-place. We crossed the river and drove up\\nthe bank a few hundred yards, then turned to the left, entered a narrow\\nalley, followed it a hundred yards and arrived at a two-story public\\nhouse; we were acquainted with its outside aspect, for it was visible\\nfrom the hotel. We went upstairs and passed into a large whitewashed\\napartment which was perhaps fifty feet long by thirty feet wide and\\ntwenty or twenty-five high. It was a well-lighted place. There was no\\ncarpet. Across one end and down both sides of the room extended a row of\\ntables, and at these tables some fifty or seventy-five students [1. See\\nAppendix C] were sitting.\\n\\nSome of them were sipping wine, others were playing cards, others chess,\\nother groups were chatting together, and many were smoking cigarettes\\nwhile they waited for the coming duels. Nearly all of them wore colored\\ncaps; there were white caps, green caps, blue caps, red caps, and\\nbright-yellow ones; so, all the five corps were present in strong\\nforce. In the windows at the vacant end of the room stood six or eight,\\nnarrow-bladed swords with large protecting guards for the hand, and\\noutside was a man at work sharpening others on a grindstone.\\n\\nHe understood his business; for when a sword left his hand one could\\nshave himself with it.\\n\\nIt was observable that the young gentlemen neither bowed to nor spoke\\nwith students whose caps differed in color from their own. This did not\\nmean hostility, but only an armed neutrality. It was considered that\\na person could strike harder in the duel, and with a more earnest\\ninterest, if he had never been in a condition of comradeship with his\\nantagonist; therefore, comradeship between the corps was not permitted.\\nAt intervals the presidents of the five corps have a cold official\\nintercourse with each other, but nothing further. For example, when the\\nregular dueling-day of one of the corps approaches, its president calls\\nfor volunteers from among the membership to offer battle; three or more\\nrespond--but there must not be less than three; the president lays their\\nnames before the other presidents, with the request that they furnish\\nantagonists for these challengers from among their corps. This is\\npromptly done. It chanced that the present occasion was the battle-day\\nof the Red Cap Corps. They were the challengers, and certain caps of\\nother colors had volunteered to meet them. The students fight duels in\\nthe room which I have described, _two days in every week during seven\\nand a half or eight months in every year_. This custom had continued in\\nGermany two hundred and fifty years.\\n\\nTo return to my narrative. A student in a white cap met us and\\nintroduced us to six or eight friends of his who also wore white caps,\\nand while we stood conversing, two strange-looking figures were led in\\nfrom another room. They were students panoplied for the duel. They were\\nbareheaded; their eyes were protected by iron goggles which projected an\\ninch or more, the leather straps of which bound their ears flat against\\ntheir heads were wound around and around with thick wrappings which\\na sword could not cut through; from chin to ankle they were padded\\nthoroughly against injury; their arms were bandaged and rebandaged,\\nlayer upon layer, until they looked like solid black logs. These weird\\napparitions had been handsome youths, clad in fashionable attire,\\nfifteen minutes before, but now they did not resemble any beings one\\never sees unless in nightmares. They strode along, with their arms\\nprojecting straight out from their bodies; they did not hold them out\\nthemselves, but fellow-students walked beside them and gave the needed\\nsupport.\\n\\nThere was a rush for the vacant end of the room, now, and we followed\\nand got good places. The combatants were placed face to face, each with\\nseveral members of his own corps about him to assist; two seconds, well\\npadded, and with swords in their hands, took their stations; a student\\nbelonging to neither of the opposing corps placed himself in a good\\nposition to umpire the combat; another student stood by with a watch and\\na memorandum-book to keep record of the time and the number and nature\\nof the wounds; a gray-haired surgeon was present with his lint, his\\nbandages, and his instruments.\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s pause the duelists saluted the umpire respectfully,\\nthen one after another the several officials stepped forward, gracefully\\nremoved their caps and saluted him also, and returned to their places.\\nEverything was ready now; students stood crowded together in the\\nforeground, and others stood behind them on chairs and tables. Every\\nface was turned toward the center of attraction.\\n\\nThe combatants were watching each other with alert eyes; a perfect\\nstillness, a breathless interest reigned. I felt that I was going to\\nsee some wary work. But not so. The instant the word was given, the two\\napparitions sprang forward and began to rain blows down upon each other\\nwith such lightning rapidity that I could not quite tell whether I saw\\nthe swords or only flashes they made in the air; the rattling din of\\nthese blows as they struck steel or paddings was something wonderfully\\nstirring, and they were struck with such terrific force that I could not\\nunderstand why the opposing sword was not beaten down under the assault.\\nPresently, in the midst of the sword-flashes, I saw a handful of hair\\nskip into the air as if it had lain loose on the victim\\'s head and a\\nbreath of wind had puffed it suddenly away.\\n\\nThe seconds cried \"Halt!\" and knocked up the combatants\\' swords with\\ntheir own. The duelists sat down; a student official stepped forward,\\nexamined the wounded head and touched the place with a sponge once or\\ntwice; the surgeon came and turned back the hair from the wound--and\\nrevealed a crimson gash two or three inches long, and proceeded to bind\\nan oval piece of leather and a bunch of lint over it; the tally-keeper\\nstepped up and tallied one for the opposition in his book.\\n\\nThen the duelists took position again; a small stream of blood was\\nflowing down the side of the injured man\\'s head, and over his shoulder\\nand down his body to the floor, but he did not seem to mind this. The\\nword was given, and they plunged at each other as fiercely as before;\\nonce more the blows rained and rattled and flashed; every few moments\\nthe quick-eyed seconds would notice that a sword was bent--then they\\ncalled \"Halt!\" struck up the contending weapons, and an assisting\\nstudent straightened the bent one.\\n\\nThe wonderful turmoil went on--presently a bright spark sprung from\\na blade, and that blade broken in several pieces, sent one of its\\nfragments flying to the ceiling. A new sword was provided and the fight\\nproceeded. The exercise was tremendous, of course, and in time the\\nfighters began to show great fatigue. They were allowed to rest a\\nmoment, every little while; they got other rests by wounding each other,\\nfor then they could sit down while the doctor applied the lint and\\nbandages. The law is that the battle must continue fifteen minutes if\\nthe men can hold out; and as the pauses do not count, this duel was\\nprotracted to twenty or thirty minutes, I judged. At last it was decided\\nthat the men were too much wearied to do battle longer. They were led\\naway drenched with crimson from head to foot. That was a good fight, but\\nit could not count, partly because it did not last the lawful fifteen\\nminutes (of actual fighting), and partly because neither man was\\ndisabled by his wound. It was a drawn battle, and corps law requires\\nthat drawn battles shall be refought as soon as the adversaries are well\\nof their hurts.\\n\\nDuring the conflict, I had talked a little, now and then, with a young\\ngentleman of the White Cap Corps, and he had mentioned that he was to\\nfight next--and had also pointed out his challenger, a young gentleman\\nwho was leaning against the opposite wall smoking a cigarette and\\nrestfully observing the duel then in progress.\\n\\nMy acquaintanceship with a party to the coming contest had the effect of\\ngiving me a kind of personal interest in it; I naturally wished he might\\nwin, and it was the reverse of pleasant to learn that he probably would\\nnot, because, although he was a notable swordsman, the challenger was\\nheld to be his superior.\\n\\nThe duel presently began and in the same furious way which had marked\\nthe previous one. I stood close by, but could not tell which blows told\\nand which did not, they fell and vanished so like flashes of light. They\\nall seemed to tell; the swords always bent over the opponents\\' heads,\\nfrom the forehead back over the crown, and seemed to touch, all the\\nway; but it was not so--a protecting blade, invisible to me, was always\\ninterposed between. At the end of ten seconds each man had struck twelve\\nor fifteen blows, and warded off twelve or fifteen, and no harm done;\\nthen a sword became disabled, and a short rest followed whilst a new one\\nwas brought. Early in the next round the White Corps student got an ugly\\nwound on the side of his head and gave his opponent one like it. In the\\nthird round the latter received another bad wound in the head, and the\\nformer had his under-lip divided. After that, the White Corps student\\ngave many severe wounds, but got none of the consequence in return.\\nAt the end of five minutes from the beginning of the duel the surgeon\\nstopped it; the challenging party had suffered such injuries that any\\naddition to them might be dangerous. These injuries were a fearful\\nspectacle, but are better left undescribed. So, against expectation, my\\nacquaintance was the victor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\n[A Sport that Sometimes Kills]\\n\\nThe third duel was brief and bloody. The surgeon stopped it when he saw\\nthat one of the men had received such bad wounds that he could not fight\\nlonger without endangering his life.\\n\\nThe fourth duel was a tremendous encounter; but at the end of five or\\nsix minutes the surgeon interfered once more: another man so severely\\nhurt as to render it unsafe to add to his harms. I watched this\\nengagement as I watched the others--with rapt interest and strong\\nexcitement, and with a shrink and a shudder for every blow that laid\\nopen a cheek or a forehead; and a conscious paling of my face when I\\noccasionally saw a wound of a yet more shocking nature inflicted.\\nMy eyes were upon the loser of this duel when he got his last and\\nvanquishing wound--it was in his face and it carried away his--but no\\nmatter, I must not enter into details. I had but a glance, and then\\nturned quickly, but I would not have been looking at all if I had known\\nwhat was coming. No, that is probably not true; one thinks he would not\\nlook if he knew what was coming, but the interest and the excitement are\\nso powerful that they would doubtless conquer all other feelings; and\\nso, under the fierce exhilaration of the clashing steel, he would yield\\nand look after all. Sometimes spectators of these duels faint--and it\\ndoes seem a very reasonable thing to do, too.\\n\\nBoth parties to this fourth duel were badly hurt so much that the\\nsurgeon was at work upon them nearly or quite an hour--a fact which is\\nsuggestive. But this waiting interval was not wasted in idleness by\\nthe assembled students. It was past noon, therefore they ordered their\\nlandlord, downstairs, to send up hot beefsteaks, chickens, and such\\nthings, and these they ate, sitting comfortable at the several tables,\\nwhilst they chatted, disputed and laughed. The door to the surgeon\\'s\\nroom stood open, meantime, but the cutting, sewing, splicing, and\\nbandaging going on in there in plain view did not seem to disturb\\nanyone\\'s appetite. I went in and saw the surgeon labor awhile, but could\\nnot enjoy; it was much less trying to see the wounds given and received\\nthan to see them mended; the stir and turmoil, and the music of the\\nsteel, were wanting here--one\\'s nerves were wrung by this grisly\\nspectacle, whilst the duel\\'s compensating pleasurable thrill was\\nlacking.\\n\\nFinally the doctor finished, and the men who were to fight the closing\\nbattle of the day came forth. A good many dinners were not completed,\\nyet, but no matter, they could be eaten cold, after the battle;\\ntherefore everybody crowded forth to see. This was not a love duel, but\\na \"satisfaction\" affair. These two students had quarreled, and were here\\nto settle it. They did not belong to any of the corps, but they were\\nfurnished with weapons and armor, and permitted to fight here by the\\nfive corps as a courtesy. Evidently these two young men were unfamiliar\\nwith the dueling ceremonies, though they were not unfamiliar with the\\nsword. When they were placed in position they thought it was time\\nto begin--and then did begin, too, and with a most impetuous energy,\\nwithout waiting for anybody to give the word. This vastly amused the\\nspectators, and even broke down their studied and courtly gravity and\\nsurprised them into laughter. Of course the seconds struck up the swords\\nand started the duel over again. At the word, the deluge of blows began,\\nbut before long the surgeon once more interfered--for the only reason\\nwhich ever permits him to interfere--and the day\\'s war was over. It was\\nnow two in the afternoon, and I had been present since half past nine in\\nthe morning. The field of battle was indeed a red one by this time;\\nbut some sawdust soon righted that. There had been one duel before I\\narrived. In it one of the men received many injuries, while the other\\none escaped without a scratch.\\n\\nI had seen the heads and faces of ten youths gashed in every direction\\nby the keen two-edged blades, and yet had not seen a victim wince, nor\\nheard a moan, or detected any fleeting expression which confessed the\\nsharp pain the hurts were inflicting. This was good fortitude, indeed.\\nSuch endurance is to be expected in savages and prize-fighters, for they\\nare born and educated to it; but to find it in such perfection in these\\ngently bred and kindly natured young fellows is matter for surprise.\\nIt was not merely under the excitement of the sword-play that this\\nfortitude was shown; it was shown in the surgeon\\'s room where an\\nuninspiring quiet reigned, and where there was no audience. The doctor\\'s\\nmanipulations brought out neither grimaces nor moans. And in the fights\\nit was observable that these lads hacked and slashed with the same\\ntremendous spirit, after they were covered with streaming wounds, which\\nthey had shown in the beginning.\\n\\nThe world in general looks upon the college duels as very farcical\\naffairs: true, but considering that the college duel is fought by boys;\\nthat the swords are real swords; and that the head and face are exposed,\\nit seems to me that it is a farce which had quite a grave side to it.\\nPeople laugh at it mainly because they think the student is so covered\\nup with armor that he cannot be hurt. But it is not so; his eyes and\\nears are protected, but the rest of his face and head are bare. He\\ncan not only be badly wounded, but his life is in danger; and he would\\nsometimes lose it but for the interference of the surgeon. It is\\nnot intended that his life shall be endangered. Fatal accidents are\\npossible, however. For instance, the student\\'s sword may break, and the\\nend of it fly up behind his antagonist\\'s ear and cut an artery which\\ncould not be reached if the sword remained whole. This has happened,\\nsometimes, and death has resulted on the spot. Formerly the student\\'s\\narmpits were not protected--and at that time the swords were pointed,\\nwhereas they are blunt, now; so an artery in the armpit was sometimes\\ncut, and death followed. Then in the days of sharp-pointed swords, a\\nspectator was an occasional victim--the end of a broken sword flew five\\nor ten feet and buried itself in his neck or his heart, and death ensued\\ninstantly. The student duels in Germany occasion two or three deaths\\nevery year, now, but this arises only from the carelessness of the\\nwounded men; they eat or drink imprudently, or commit excesses in the\\nway of overexertion; inflammation sets in and gets such a headway that\\nit cannot be arrested. Indeed, there is blood and pain and danger\\nenough about the college duel to entitle it to a considerable degree of\\nrespect.\\n\\nAll the customs, all the laws, all the details, pertaining to the\\nstudent duel are quaint and naive. The grave, precise, and courtly\\nceremony with which the thing is conducted, invests it with a sort of\\nantique charm.\\n\\nThis dignity and these knightly graces suggest the tournament, not the\\nprize-fight. The laws are as curious as they are strict. For instance,\\nthe duelist may step forward from the line he is placed upon, if he\\nchooses, but never back of it. If he steps back of it, or even leans\\nback, it is considered that he did it to avoid a blow or contrive an\\nadvantage; so he is dismissed from his corps in disgrace. It would seem\\nnatural to step from under a descending sword unconsciously, and against\\none\\'s will and intent--yet this unconsciousness is not allowed. Again:\\nif under the sudden anguish of a wound the receiver of it makes a\\ngrimace, he falls some degrees in the estimation of his fellows; his\\ncorps are ashamed of him: they call him \"hare foot,\" which is the German\\nequivalent for chicken-hearted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\n[How Bismark Fought]\\n\\nIn addition to the corps laws, there are some corps usages which have\\nthe force of laws.\\n\\nPerhaps the president of a corps notices that one of the membership who\\nis no longer an exempt--that is a freshman--has remained a sophomore\\nsome little time without volunteering to fight; some day, the president,\\ninstead of calling for volunteers, will _appoint_ this sophomore\\nto measure swords with a student of another corps; he is free to\\ndecline--everybody says so--there is no compulsion. This is all\\ntrue--but I have not heard of any student who _did_ decline; to decline\\nand still remain in the corps would make him unpleasantly conspicuous,\\nand properly so, since he knew, when he joined, that his main\\nbusiness, as a member, would be to fight. No, there is no law against\\ndeclining--except the law of custom, which is confessedly stronger than\\nwritten law, everywhere.\\n\\nThe ten men whose duels I had witnessed did not go away when their hurts\\nwere dressed, as I had supposed they would, but came back, one after\\nanother, as soon as they were free of the surgeon, and mingled with the\\nassemblage in the dueling-room. The white-cap student who won the second\\nfight witnessed the remaining three, and talked with us during the\\nintermissions. He could not talk very well, because his opponent\\'s sword\\nhad cut his under-lip in two, and then the surgeon had sewed it together\\nand overlaid it with a profusion of white plaster patches; neither could\\nhe eat easily, still he contrived to accomplish a slow and troublesome\\nluncheon while the last duel was preparing. The man who was the worst\\nhurt of all played chess while waiting to see this engagement. A good\\npart of his face was covered with patches and bandages, and all the rest\\nof his head was covered and concealed by them.\\n\\nIt is said that the student likes to appear on the street and in other\\npublic places in this kind of array, and that this predilection often\\nkeeps him out when exposure to rain or sun is a positive danger for\\nhim. Newly bandaged students are a very common spectacle in the public\\ngardens of Heidelberg. It is also said that the student is glad to\\nget wounds in the face, because the scars they leave will show so well\\nthere; and it is also said that these face wounds are so prized that\\nyouths have even been known to pull them apart from time to time and\\nput red wine in them to make them heal badly and leave as ugly a scar\\nas possible. It does not look reasonable, but it is roundly asserted\\nand maintained, nevertheless; I am sure of one thing--scars are plenty\\nenough in Germany, among the young men; and very grim ones they are,\\ntoo. They crisscross the face in angry red welts, and are permanent and\\nineffaceable.\\n\\nSome of these scars are of a very strange and dreadful aspect; and the\\neffect is striking when several such accent the milder ones, which form\\na city map on a man\\'s face; they suggest the \"burned district\" then. We\\nhad often noticed that many of the students wore a colored silk band\\nor ribbon diagonally across their breasts. It transpired that this\\nsignifies that the wearer has fought three duels in which a decision\\nwas reached--duels in which he either whipped or was whipped--for drawn\\nbattles do not count. [1] After a student has received his ribbon, he\\nis \"free\"; he can cease from fighting, without reproach--except some one\\ninsult him; his president cannot appoint him to fight; he can volunteer\\nif he wants to, or remain quiescent if he prefers to do so. Statistics\\nshow that he does _not_ prefer to remain quiescent. They show that the\\nduel has a singular fascination about it somewhere, for these free\\nmen, so far from resting upon the privilege of the badge, are always\\nvolunteering. A corps student told me it was of record that Prince\\nBismarck fought thirty-two of these duels in a single summer term when\\nhe was in college. So he fought twenty-nine after his badge had given\\nhim the right to retire from the field.\\n\\n1. _From My Diary_.--Dined in a hotel a few miles up the Neckar, in a\\nroom whose walls were hung all over with framed portrait-groups of the\\nFive Corps; some were recent, but many antedated photography, and were\\npictured in lithography--the dates ranged back to forty or fifty years\\nago. Nearly every individual wore the ribbon across his breast. In one\\nportrait-group representing (as each of these pictures did) an entire\\nCorps, I took pains to count the ribbons: there were twenty-seven\\nmembers, and twenty-one of them wore that significant badge.\\n\\nThe statistics may be found to possess interest in several particulars.\\nTwo days in every week are devoted to dueling. The rule is rigid that\\nthere must be three duels on each of these days; there are generally\\nmore, but there cannot be fewer. There were six the day I was present;\\nsometimes there are seven or eight. It is insisted that eight duels a\\nweek--four for each of the two days--is too low an average to draw\\na calculation from, but I will reckon from that basis, preferring an\\nunderstatement to an overstatement of the case. This requires about four\\nhundred and eighty or five hundred duelists a year--for in summer the\\ncollege term is about three and a half months, and in winter it is four\\nmonths and sometimes longer. Of the seven hundred and fifty students in\\nthe university at the time I am writing of, only eighty belonged to the\\nfive corps, and it is only these corps that do the dueling; occasionally\\nother students borrow the arms and battleground of the five corps in\\norder to settle a quarrel, but this does not happen every dueling-day.\\n[2] Consequently eighty youths furnish the material for some two hundred\\nand fifty duels a year. This average gives six fights a year to each\\nof the eighty. This large work could not be accomplished if the\\nbadge-holders stood upon their privilege and ceased to volunteer.\\n\\n2. They have to borrow the arms because they could not get them\\nelsewhere or otherwise. As I understand it, the public authorities, all\\nover Germany, allow the five Corps to keep swords, but _do not allow\\nthem to use them_. This is law is rigid; it is only the execution of it\\nthat is lax.\\n\\nOf course, where there is so much fighting, the students make it a point\\nto keep themselves in constant practice with the foil. One often sees\\nthem, at the tables in the Castle grounds, using their whips or canes to\\nillustrate some new sword trick which they have heard about; and between\\nthe duels, on the day whose history I have been writing, the swords were\\nnot always idle; every now and then we heard a succession of the keen\\nhissing sounds which the sword makes when it is being put through its\\npaces in the air, and this informed us that a student was practicing.\\nNecessarily, this unceasing attention to the art develops an expert\\noccasionally. He becomes famous in his own university, his renown\\nspreads to other universities. He is invited to Goettingen, to fight\\nwith a Goettingen expert; if he is victorious, he will be invited\\nto other colleges, or those colleges will send their experts to him.\\nAmericans and Englishmen often join one or another of the five corps. A\\nyear or two ago, the principal Heidelberg expert was a big Kentuckian;\\nhe was invited to the various universities and left a wake of victory\\nbehind him all about Germany; but at last a little student in Strasburg\\ndefeated him. There was formerly a student in Heidelberg who had picked\\nup somewhere and mastered a peculiar trick of cutting up under instead\\nof cleaving down from above. While the trick lasted he won in sixteen\\nsuccessive duels in his university; but by that time observers had\\ndiscovered what his charm was, and how to break it, therefore his\\nchampionship ceased.\\n\\nA rule which forbids social intercourse between members of different\\ncorps is strict. In the dueling-house, in the parks, on the street,\\nand anywhere and everywhere that the students go, caps of a color group\\nthemselves together. If all the tables in a public garden were crowded\\nbut one, and that one had two red-cap students at it and ten vacant\\nplaces, the yellow-caps, the blue-caps, the white caps, and the green\\ncaps, seeking seats, would go by that table and not seem to see it, nor\\nseem to be aware that there was such a table in the grounds. The student\\nby whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the dueling-place, wore\\nthe white cap--Prussian Corps. He introduced us to many white caps, but\\nto none of another color. The corps etiquette extended even to us, who\\nwere strangers, and required us to group with the white corps only, and\\nspeak only with the white corps, while we were their guests, and keep\\naloof from the caps of the other colors. Once I wished to examine some\\nof the swords, but an American student said, \"It would not be quite\\npolite; these now in the windows all have red hilts or blue; they will\\nbring in some with white hilts presently, and those you can handle\\nfreely.\" When a sword was broken in the first duel, I wanted a piece\\nof it; but its hilt was the wrong color, so it was considered best and\\npolitest to await a properer season.\\n\\nIt was brought to me after the room was cleared, and I will now make\\na \"life-size\" sketch of it by tracing a line around it with my pen, to\\nshow the width of the weapon. [Figure 1] The length of these swords is\\nabout three feet, and they are quite heavy. One\\'s disposition to cheer,\\nduring the course of the duels or at their close, was naturally strong,\\nbut corps etiquette forbade any demonstrations of this sort. However\\nbrilliant a contest or a victory might be, no sign or sound betrayed\\nthat any one was moved. A dignified gravity and repression were\\nmaintained at all times.\\n\\nWhen the dueling was finished and we were ready to go, the gentlemen of\\nthe Prussian Corps to whom we had been introduced took off their caps\\nin the courteous German way, and also shook hands; their brethren of the\\nsame order took off their caps and bowed, but without shaking hands; the\\ngentlemen of the other corps treated us just as they would have treated\\nwhite caps--they fell apart, apparently unconsciously, and left us an\\nunobstructed pathway, but did not seem to see us or know we were there.\\nIf we had gone thither the following week as guests of another corps,\\nthe white caps, without meaning any offense, would have observed the\\netiquette of their order and ignored our presence.\\n\\n[How strangely are comedy and tragedy blended in this life! I had not\\nbeen home a full half-hour, after witnessing those playful sham-duels,\\nwhen circumstances made it necessary for me to get ready immediately to\\nassist personally at a real one--a duel with no effeminate limitation in\\nthe matter of results, but a battle to the death. An account of it, in\\nthe next chapter, will show the reader that duels between boys, for fun,\\nand duels between men in earnest, are very different affairs.]\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note for Edition 12: on the advice of two German-speaking\\nvolunteers, the German letters a, o, and u with umlauts have been\\nrendered as ae, oe, and ue instead of as, variously, :a, a\", :o, o\" and\\n:u, u\" as in previous editions.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nThe Great French Duel\\n\\n[I Second Gambetta in a Terrific Duel]\\n\\nMuch as the modern French duel is ridiculed by certain smart people, it\\nis in reality one of the most dangerous institutions of our day. Since\\nit is always fought in the open air, the combatants are nearly sure\\nto catch cold. M. Paul de Cassagnac, the most inveterate of the French\\nduelists, had suffered so often in this way that he is at last a\\nconfirmed invalid; and the best physician in Paris has expressed\\nthe opinion that if he goes on dueling for fifteen or twenty years\\nmore--unless he forms the habit of fighting in a comfortable room where\\ndamps and draughts cannot intrude--he will eventually endanger his life.\\nThis ought to moderate the talk of those people who are so stubborn\\nin maintaining that the French duel is the most health-giving of\\nrecreations because of the open-air exercise it affords. And it\\nought also to moderate that foolish talk about French duelists and\\nsocialist-hated monarchs being the only people who are immortal.\\n\\nBut it is time to get at my subject. As soon as I heard of the late\\nfiery outbreak between M. Gambetta and M. Fourtou in the French\\nAssembly, I knew that trouble must follow. I knew it because a long\\npersonal friendship with M. Gambetta revealed to me the desperate and\\nimplacable nature of the man. Vast as are his physical proportions,\\nI knew that the thirst for revenge would penetrate to the remotest\\nfrontiers of his person.\\n\\nI did not wait for him to call on me, but went at once to him. As I had\\nexpected, I found the brave fellow steeped in a profound French calm.\\nI say French calm, because French calmness and English calmness have\\npoints of difference.\\n\\nHe was moving swiftly back and forth among the debris of his furniture,\\nnow and then staving chance fragments of it across the room with his\\nfoot; grinding a constant grist of curses through his set teeth; and\\nhalting every little while to deposit another handful of his hair on the\\npile which he had been building of it on the table.\\n\\nHe threw his arms around my neck, bent me over his stomach to his\\nbreast, kissed me on both cheeks, hugged me four or five times, and\\nthen placed me in his own arm-chair. As soon as I had got well again, we\\nbegan business at once.\\n\\nI said I supposed he would wish me to act as his second, and he said,\\n\"Of course.\" I said I must be allowed to act under a French name, so\\nthat I might be shielded from obloquy in my country, in case of fatal\\nresults. He winced here, probably at the suggestion that dueling was not\\nregarded with respect in America. However, he agreed to my requirement.\\nThis accounts for the fact that in all the newspaper reports M.\\nGambetta\\'s second was apparently a Frenchman.\\n\\nFirst, we drew up my principal\\'s will. I insisted upon this, and stuck\\nto my point. I said I had never heard of a man in his right mind going\\nout to fight a duel without first making his will. He said he had never\\nheard of a man in his right mind doing anything of the kind. When he had\\nfinished the will, he wished to proceed to a choice of his \"last words.\"\\nHe wanted to know how the following words, as a dying exclamation,\\nstruck me:\\n\\n\"I die for my God, for my country, for freedom of speech, for progress,\\nand the universal brotherhood of man!\"\\n\\nI objected that this would require too lingering a death; it was a good\\nspeech for a consumptive, but not suited to the exigencies of the field\\nof honor. We wrangled over a good many ante-mortem outbursts, but I\\nfinally got him to cut his obituary down to this, which he copied into\\nhis memorandum-book, purposing to get it by heart:\\n\\n\"I DIE THAT FRANCE MIGHT LIVE.\"\\n\\nI said that this remark seemed to lack relevancy; but he said relevancy\\nwas a matter of no consequence in last words, what you wanted was\\nthrill.\\n\\nThe next thing in order was the choice of weapons. My principal said he\\nwas not feeling well, and would leave that and the other details of the\\nproposed meeting to me. Therefore I wrote the following note and carried\\nit to M. Fourtou\\'s friend:\\n\\nSir: M. Gambetta accepts M. Fourtou\\'s challenge, and authorizes me to\\npropose Plessis-Piquet as the place of meeting; tomorrow morning at\\ndaybreak as the time; and axes as the weapons.\\n\\nI am, sir, with great respect,\\n\\nMark Twain.\\n\\nM. Fourtou\\'s friend read this note, and shuddered. Then he turned to me,\\nand said, with a suggestion of severity in his tone:\\n\\n\"Have you considered, sir, what would be the inevitable result of such a\\nmeeting as this?\"\\n\\n\"Well, for instance, what _would_ it be?\"\\n\\n\"Bloodshed!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s about the size of it,\" I said. \"Now, if it is a fair question,\\nwhat was your side proposing to shed?\"\\n\\nI had him there. He saw he had made a blunder, so he hastened to explain\\nit away. He said he had spoken jestingly. Then he added that he and his\\nprincipal would enjoy axes, and indeed prefer them, but such weapons\\nwere barred by the French code, and so I must change my proposal.\\n\\nI walked the floor, turning the thing over in my mind, and finally it\\noccurred to me that Gatling-guns at fifteen paces would be a likely way\\nto get a verdict on the field of honor. So I framed this idea into a\\nproposition.\\n\\nBut it was not accepted. The code was in the way again. I proposed\\nrifles; then double-barreled shotguns; then Colt\\'s navy revolvers. These\\nbeing all rejected, I reflected awhile, and sarcastically suggested\\nbrickbats at three-quarters of a mile. I always hate to fool away a\\nhumorous thing on a person who has no perception of humor; and it filled\\nme with bitterness when this man went soberly away to submit the last\\nproposition to his principal.\\n\\nHe came back presently and said his principal was charmed with the idea\\nof brickbats at three-quarters of a mile, but must decline on account of\\nthe danger to disinterested parties passing between them. Then I said:\\n\\n\"Well, I am at the end of my string, now. Perhaps _you_ would be good\\nenough to suggest a weapon? Perhaps you have even had one in your mind\\nall the time?\"\\n\\nHis countenance brightened, and he said with alacrity:\\n\\n\"Oh, without doubt, monsieur!\"\\n\\nSo he fell to hunting in his pockets--pocket after pocket, and he had\\nplenty of them--muttering all the while, \"Now, what could I have done\\nwith them?\"\\n\\nAt last he was successful. He fished out of his vest pocket a couple\\nof little things which I carried to the light and ascertained to be\\npistols. They were single-barreled and silver-mounted, and very dainty\\nand pretty. I was not able to speak for emotion. I silently hung one of\\nthem on my watch-chain, and returned the other. My companion in crime\\nnow unrolled a postage-stamp containing several cartridges, and gave me\\none of them. I asked if he meant to signify by this that our men were\\nto be allowed but one shot apiece. He replied that the French code\\npermitted no more. I then begged him to go and suggest a distance, for\\nmy mind was growing weak and confused under the strain which had been\\nput upon it. He named sixty-five yards. I nearly lost my patience. I\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"Sixty-five yards, with these instruments? Squirt-guns would be deadlier\\nat fifty. Consider, my friend, you and I are banded together to destroy\\nlife, not make it eternal.\"\\n\\nBut with all my persuasions, all my arguments, I was only able to\\nget him to reduce the distance to thirty-five yards; and even this\\nconcession he made with reluctance, and said with a sigh, \"I wash my\\nhands of this slaughter; on your head be it.\"\\n\\nThere was nothing for me but to go home to my old lion-heart and tell my\\nhumiliating story. When I entered, M. Gambetta was laying his last lock\\nof hair upon the altar. He sprang toward me, exclaiming:\\n\\n\"You have made the fatal arrangements--I see it in your eye!\"\\n\\n\"I have.\"\\n\\nHis face paled a trifle, and he leaned upon the table for support. He\\nbreathed thick and heavily for a moment or two, so tumultuous were his\\nfeelings; then he hoarsely whispered:\\n\\n\"The weapon, the weapon! Quick! what is the weapon?\"\\n\\n\"This!\" and I displayed that silver-mounted thing. He cast but one\\nglance at it, then swooned ponderously to the floor.\\n\\nWhen he came to, he said mournfully:\\n\\n\"The unnatural calm to which I have subjected myself has told upon my\\nnerves. But away with weakness! I will confront my fate like a man and a\\nFrenchman.\"\\n\\nHe rose to his feet, and assumed an attitude which for sublimity has\\nnever been approached by man, and has seldom been surpassed by statues.\\nThen he said, in his deep bass tones:\\n\\n\"Behold, I am calm, I am ready; reveal to me the distance.\"\\n\\n\"Thirty-five yards.\" ...\\n\\nI could not lift him up, of course; but I rolled him over, and poured\\nwater down his back. He presently came to, and said:\\n\\n\"Thirty-five yards--without a rest? But why ask? Since murder was that\\nman\\'s intention, why should he palter with small details? But mark you\\none thing: in my fall the world shall see how the chivalry of France\\nmeets death.\"\\n\\nAfter a long silence he asked:\\n\\n\"Was nothing said about that man\\'s family standing up with him, as\\nan offset to my bulk? But no matter; I would not stoop to make such\\na suggestion; if he is not noble enough to suggest it himself, he is\\nwelcome to this advantage, which no honorable man would take.\"\\n\\nHe now sank into a sort of stupor of reflection, which lasted some\\nminutes; after which he broke silence with:\\n\\n\"The hour--what is the hour fixed for the collision?\"\\n\\n\"Dawn, tomorrow.\"\\n\\nHe seemed greatly surprised, and immediately said:\\n\\n\"Insanity! I never heard of such a thing. Nobody is abroad at such an\\nhour.\"\\n\\n\"That is the reason I named it. Do you mean to say you want an\\naudience?\"\\n\\n\"It is no time to bandy words. I am astonished that M. Fourtou should\\never have agreed to so strange an innovation. Go at once and require a\\nlater hour.\"\\n\\nI ran downstairs, threw open the front door, and almost plunged into the\\narms of M. Fourtou\\'s second. He said:\\n\\n\"I have the honor to say that my principal strenuously objects to the\\nhour chosen, and begs you will consent to change it to half past nine.\"\\n\\n\"Any courtesy, sir, which it is in our power to extend is at the service\\nof your excellent principal. We agree to the proposed change of time.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you to accept the thanks of my client.\" Then he turned to a\\nperson behind him, and said, \"You hear, M. Noir, the hour is altered to\\nhalf past nine.\" Whereupon M. Noir bowed, expressed his thanks, and went\\naway. My accomplice continued:\\n\\n\"If agreeable to you, your chief surgeons and ours shall proceed to the\\nfield in the same carriage as is customary.\"\\n\\n\"It is entirely agreeable to me, and I am obliged to you for mentioning\\nthe surgeons, for I am afraid I should not have thought of them. How\\nmany shall I want? I supposed two or three will be enough?\"\\n\\n\"Two is the customary number for each party. I refer to \\'chief\\'\\nsurgeons; but considering the exalted positions occupied by our clients,\\nit will be well and decorous that each of us appoint several consulting\\nsurgeons, from among the highest in the profession. These will come in\\ntheir own private carriages. Have you engaged a hearse?\"\\n\\n\"Bless my stupidity, I never thought of it! I will attend to it right\\naway. I must seem very ignorant to you; but you must try to overlook\\nthat, because I have never had any experience of such a swell duel as\\nthis before. I have had a good deal to do with duels on the Pacific\\ncoast, but I see now that they were crude affairs. A hearse--sho! we\\nused to leave the elected lying around loose, and let anybody cord\\nthem up and cart them off that wanted to. Have you anything further to\\nsuggest?\"\\n\\n\"Nothing, except that the head undertakers shall ride together, as is\\nusual. The subordinates and mutes will go on foot, as is also usual. I\\nwill see you at eight o\\'clock in the morning, and we will then arrange\\nthe order of the procession. I have the honor to bid you a good day.\"\\n\\nI returned to my client, who said, \"Very well; at what hour is the\\nengagement to begin?\"\\n\\n\"Half past nine.\"\\n\\n\"Very good indeed. Have you sent the fact to the newspapers?\"\\n\\n\"_Sir_! If after our long and intimate friendship you can for a moment\\ndeem me capable of so base a treachery--\"\\n\\n\"Tut, tut! What words are these, my dear friend? Have I wounded you? Ah,\\nforgive me; I am overloading you with labor. Therefore go on with the\\nother details, and drop this one from your list. The bloody-minded\\nFourtou will be sure to attend to it. Or I myself--yes, to make certain,\\nI will drop a note to my journalistic friend, M. Noir--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, come to think of it, you may save yourself the trouble; that other\\nsecond has informed M. Noir.\"\\n\\n\"H\\'m! I might have known it. It is just like that Fourtou, who always\\nwants to make a display.\"\\n\\nAt half past nine in the morning the procession approached the field of\\nPlessis-Piquet in the following order: first came our carriage--nobody\\nin it but M. Gambetta and myself; then a carriage containing M. Fourtou\\nand his second; then a carriage containing two poet-orators who did not\\nbelieve in God, and these had MS. funeral orations projecting from their\\nbreast pockets; then a carriage containing the head surgeons and their\\ncases of instruments; then eight private carriages containing consulting\\nsurgeons; then a hack containing a coroner; then the two hearses; then a\\ncarriage containing the head undertakers; then a train of assistants\\nand mutes on foot; and after these came plodding through the fog a long\\nprocession of camp followers, police, and citizens generally. It was a\\nnoble turnout, and would have made a fine display if we had had thinner\\nweather.\\n\\nThere was no conversation. I spoke several times to my principal, but\\nI judge he was not aware of it, for he always referred to his note-book\\nand muttered absently, \"I die that France might live.\"\\n\\nArrived on the field, my fellow-second and I paced off the thirty-five\\nyards, and then drew lots for choice of position. This latter was but\\nan ornamental ceremony, for all the choices were alike in such weather.\\nThese preliminaries being ended, I went to my principal and asked him\\nif he was ready. He spread himself out to his full width, and said in a\\nstern voice, \"Ready! Let the batteries be charged.\"\\n\\nThe loading process was done in the presence of duly constituted\\nwitnesses. We considered it best to perform this delicate service with\\nthe assistance of a lantern, on account of the state of the weather. We\\nnow placed our men.\\n\\nAt this point the police noticed that the public had massed themselves\\ntogether on the right and left of the field; they therefore begged a\\ndelay, while they should put these poor people in a place of safety.\\n\\nThe request was granted.\\n\\nThe police having ordered the two multitudes to take positions behind\\nthe duelists, we were once more ready. The weather growing still more\\nopaque, it was agreed between myself and the other second that before\\ngiving the fatal signal we should each deliver a loud whoop to enable\\nthe combatants to ascertain each other\\'s whereabouts.\\n\\nI now returned to my principal, and was distressed to observe that he\\nhad lost a good deal of his spirit. I tried my best to hearten him. I\\nsaid, \"Indeed, sir, things are not as bad as they seem. Considering\\nthe character of the weapons, the limited number of shots allowed, the\\ngenerous distance, the impenetrable solidity of the fog, and the added\\nfact that one of the combatants is one-eyed and the other cross-eyed and\\nnear-sighted, it seems to me that this conflict need not necessarily be\\nfatal. There are chances that both of you may survive. Therefore, cheer\\nup; do not be downhearted.\"\\n\\nThis speech had so good an effect that my principal immediately\\nstretched forth his hand and said, \"I am myself again; give me the\\nweapon.\"\\n\\nI laid it, all lonely and forlorn, in the center of the vast solitude\\nof his palm. He gazed at it and shuddered. And still mournfully\\ncontemplating it, he murmured in a broken voice:\\n\\n\"Alas, it is not death I dread, but mutilation.\"\\n\\nI heartened him once more, and with such success that he presently\\nsaid, \"Let the tragedy begin. Stand at my back; do not desert me in this\\nsolemn hour, my friend.\"\\n\\nI gave him my promise. I now assisted him to point his pistol toward the\\nspot where I judged his adversary to be standing, and cautioned him to\\nlisten well and further guide himself by my fellow-second\\'s whoop.\\nThen I propped myself against M. Gambetta\\'s back, and raised a rousing\\n\"Whoop-ee!\" This was answered from out the far distances of the fog, and\\nI immediately shouted:\\n\\n\"One--two--three--FIRE!\"\\n\\nTwo little sounds like _spit! spit!_ broke upon my ear, and in the same\\ninstant I was crushed to the earth under a mountain of flesh. Bruised\\nas I was, I was still able to catch a faint accent from above, to this\\neffect:\\n\\n\"I die for... for ... perdition take it, what _is_ it I die for? ... oh,\\nyes--_France_! I die that France may live!\"\\n\\nThe surgeons swarmed around with their probes in their hands, and\\napplied their microscopes to the whole area of M. Gambetta\\'s person,\\nwith the happy result of finding nothing in the nature of a wound. Then\\na scene ensued which was in every way gratifying and inspiriting.\\n\\nThe two gladiators fell upon each other\\'s neck, with floods of proud and\\nhappy tears; that other second embraced me; the surgeons, the\\norators, the undertakers, the police, everybody embraced, everybody\\ncongratulated, everybody cried, and the whole atmosphere was filled with\\npraise and with joy unspeakable.\\n\\nIt seems to me then that I would rather be a hero of a French duel than\\na crowned and sceptered monarch.\\n\\nWhen the commotion had somewhat subsided, the body of surgeons held a\\nconsultation, and after a good deal of debate decided that with proper\\ncare and nursing there was reason to believe that I would survive my\\ninjuries. My internal hurts were deemed the most serious, since it was\\napparent that a broken rib had penetrated my left lung, and that many of\\nmy organs had been pressed out so far to one side or the other of where\\nthey belonged, that it was doubtful if they would ever learn to perform\\ntheir functions in such remote and unaccustomed localities. They then\\nset my left arm in two places, pulled my right hip into its socket\\nagain, and re-elevated my nose. I was an object of great interest,\\nand even admiration; and many sincere and warm-hearted persons had\\nthemselves introduced to me, and said they were proud to know the only\\nman who had been hurt in a French duel in forty years.\\n\\nI was placed in an ambulance at the very head of the procession;\\nand thus with gratifying \\'_eclat_ I was marched into Paris, the most\\nconspicuous figure in that great spectacle, and deposited at the\\nhospital.\\n\\nThe cross of the Legion of Honor has been conferred upon me. However,\\nfew escape that distinction.\\n\\nSuch is the true version of the most memorable private conflict of the\\nage.\\n\\nI have no complaints to make against any one. I acted for myself, and I\\ncan stand the consequences.\\n\\nWithout boasting, I think I may say I am not afraid to stand before a\\nmodern French duelist, but as long as I keep in my right mind I will\\nnever consent to stand behind one again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\n[What the Beautiful Maiden Said]\\n\\nOne day we took the train and went down to Mannheim to see \"King Lear\"\\nplayed in German. It was a mistake. We sat in our seats three whole\\nhours and never understood anything but the thunder and lightning; and\\neven that was reversed to suit German ideas, for the thunder came first\\nand the lightning followed after.\\n\\nThe behavior of the audience was perfect. There were no rustlings, or\\nwhisperings, or other little disturbances; each act was listened to in\\nsilence, and the applauding was done after the curtain was down. The\\ndoors opened at half past four, the play began promptly at half past\\nfive, and within two minutes afterward all who were coming were in their\\nseats, and quiet reigned. A German gentleman in the train had said that\\na Shakespearian play was an appreciated treat in Germany and that\\nwe should find the house filled. It was true; all the six tiers were\\nfilled, and remained so to the end--which suggested that it is not only\\nbalcony people who like Shakespeare in Germany, but those of the pit and\\ngallery, too.\\n\\nAnother time, we went to Mannheim and attended a shivaree--otherwise an\\nopera--the one called \"Lohengrin.\" The banging and slamming and booming\\nand crashing were something beyond belief. The racking and pitiless pain\\nof it remains stored up in my memory alongside the memory of the time\\nthat I had my teeth fixed.\\n\\nThere were circumstances which made it necessary for me to stay through\\nthe four hours to the end, and I stayed; but the recollection of that\\nlong, dragging, relentless season of suffering is indestructible. To\\nhave to endure it in silence, and sitting still, made it all the harder.\\nI was in a railed compartment with eight or ten strangers, of the two\\nsexes, and this compelled repression; yet at times the pain was so\\nexquisite that I could hardly keep the tears back.\\n\\nAt those times, as the howlings and wailings and shrieking of the\\nsingers, and the ragings and roarings and explosions of the vast\\norchestra rose higher and higher, and wilder and wilder, and fiercer and\\nfiercer, I could have cried if I had been alone. Those strangers would\\nnot have been surprised to see a man do such a thing who was being\\ngradually skinned, but they would have marveled at it here, and made\\nremarks about it no doubt, whereas there was nothing in the present case\\nwhich was an advantage over being skinned.\\n\\nThere was a wait of half an hour at the end of the first act, and I\\ncould have gone out and rested during that time, but I could not trust\\nmyself to do it, for I felt that I should desert to stay out. There was\\nanother wait of half an hour toward nine o\\'clock, but I had gone through\\nso much by that time that I had no spirit left, and so had no desire but\\nto be let alone.\\n\\nI do not wish to suggest that the rest of the people there were like\\nme, for, indeed, they were not. Whether it was that they naturally\\nliked that noise, or whether it was that they had learned to like it\\nby getting used to it, I did not at the time know; but they did like\\nit--this was plain enough. While it was going on they sat and looked as\\nrapt and grateful as cats do when one strokes their backs; and whenever\\nthe curtain fell they rose to their feet, in one solid mighty multitude,\\nand the air was snowed thick with waving handkerchiefs, and hurricanes\\nof applause swept the place. This was not comprehensible to me. Of\\ncourse, there were many people there who were not under compulsion to\\nstay; yet the tiers were as full at the close as they had been at the\\nbeginning. This showed that the people liked it.\\n\\nIt was a curious sort of a play. In the manner of costumes and scenery\\nit was fine and showy enough; but there was not much action. That is\\nto say, there was not much really done, it was only talked about; and\\nalways violently. It was what one might call a narrative play. Everybody\\nhad a narrative and a grievance, and none were reasonable about it, but\\nall in an offensive and ungovernable state. There was little of that\\nsort of customary thing where the tenor and the soprano stand down by\\nthe footlights, warbling, with blended voices, and keep holding out\\ntheir arms toward each other and drawing them back and spreading both\\nhands over first one breast and then the other with a shake and a\\npressure--no, it was every rioter for himself and no blending. Each sang\\nhis indictive narrative in turn, accompanied by the whole orchestra of\\nsixty instruments, and when this had continued for some time, and one\\nwas hoping they might come to an understanding and modify the noise, a\\ngreat chorus composed entirely of maniacs would suddenly break forth,\\nand then during two minutes, and sometimes three, I lived over again all\\nthat I suffered the time the orphan asylum burned down.\\n\\nWe only had one brief little season of heaven and heaven\\'s sweet ecstasy\\nand peace during all this long and diligent and acrimonious reproduction\\nof the other place. This was while a gorgeous procession of people\\nmarched around and around, in the third act, and sang the Wedding\\nChorus. To my untutored ear that was music--almost divine music. While\\nmy seared soul was steeped in the healing balm of those gracious sounds,\\nit seemed to me that I could almost resuffer the torments which had\\ngone before, in order to be so healed again. There is where the deep\\ningenuity of the operatic idea is betrayed. It deals so largely in pain\\nthat its scattered delights are prodigiously augmented by the contrasts.\\nA pretty air in an opera is prettier there than it could be anywhere\\nelse, I suppose, just as an honest man in politics shines more than he\\nwould elsewhere.\\n\\nI have since found out that there is nothing the Germans like so much as\\nan opera. They like it, not in a mild and moderate way, but with their\\nwhole hearts. This is a legitimate result of habit and education. Our\\nnation will like the opera, too, by and by, no doubt. One in fifty of\\nthose who attend our operas likes it already, perhaps, but I think a\\ngood many of the other forty-nine go in order to learn to like it, and\\nthe rest in order to be able to talk knowingly about it. The latter\\nusually hum the airs while they are being sung, so that their neighbors\\nmay perceive that they have been to operas before. The funerals of these\\ndo not occur often enough.\\n\\nA gentle, old-maidish person and a sweet young girl of seventeen sat\\nright in front of us that night at the Mannheim opera. These people\\ntalked, between the acts, and I understood them, though I understood\\nnothing that was uttered on the distant stage. At first they were\\nguarded in their talk, but after they had heard my agent and me\\nconversing in English they dropped their reserve and I picked up many\\nof their little confidences; no, I mean many of _her_ little\\nconfidences--meaning the elder party--for the young girl only listened,\\nand gave assenting nods, but never said a word. How pretty she was,\\nand how sweet she was! I wished she would speak. But evidently she was\\nabsorbed in her own thoughts, her own young-girl dreams, and found a\\ndearer pleasure in silence. But she was not dreaming sleepy dreams--no,\\nshe was awake, alive, alert, she could not sit still a moment. She was\\nan enchanting study. Her gown was of a soft white silky stuff that clung\\nto her round young figure like a fish\\'s skin, and it was rippled over\\nwith the gracefulest little fringy films of lace; she had deep, tender\\neyes, with long, curved lashes; and she had peachy cheeks, and a\\ndimpled chin, and such a dear little rosebud of a mouth; and she was so\\ndovelike, so pure, and so gracious, so sweet and so bewitching. For long\\nhours I did mightily wish she would speak. And at last she did; the red\\nlips parted, and out leaps her thought--and with such a guileless and\\npretty enthusiasm, too: \"Auntie, I just _know_ I\\'ve got five hundred\\nfleas on me!\"\\n\\nThat was probably over the average. Yes, it must have been very much\\nover the average. The average at that time in the Grand Duchy of Baden\\nwas forty-five to a young person (when alone), according to the official\\nestimate of the home secretary for that year; the average for older\\npeople was shifty and indeterminable, for whenever a wholesome young\\ngirl came into the presence of her elders she immediately lowered their\\naverage and raised her own. She became a sort of contribution-box.\\n\\nThis dear young thing in the theater had been sitting there\\nunconsciously taking up a collection. Many a skinny old being in our\\nneighborhood was the happier and the restfuler for her coming.\\n\\nIn that large audience, that night, there were eight very conspicuous\\npeople. These were ladies who had their hats or bonnets on. What a\\nblessed thing it would be if a lady could make herself conspicuous in\\nour theaters by wearing her hat.\\n\\nIt is not usual in Europe to allow ladies and gentlemen to take bonnets,\\nhats, overcoats, canes, or umbrellas into the auditorium, but in\\nMannheim this rule was not enforced because the audiences were largely\\nmade up of people from a distance, and among these were always a few\\ntimid ladies who were afraid that if they had to go into an anteroom to\\nget their things when the play was over, they would miss their train.\\nBut the great mass of those who came from a distance always ran the risk\\nand took the chances, preferring the loss of a train to a breach of good\\nmanners and the discomfort of being unpleasantly conspicuous during a\\nstretch of three or four hours.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\n[How Wagner Operas Bang Along]\\n\\nThree or four hours. That is a long time to sit in one place, whether\\none be conspicuous or not, yet some of Wagner\\'s operas bang along for\\nsix whole hours on a stretch! But the people sit there and enjoy it all,\\nand wish it would last longer. A German lady in Munich told me that a\\nperson could not like Wagner\\'s music at first, but must go through the\\ndeliberate process of learning to like it--then he would have his sure\\nreward; for when he had learned to like it he would hunger for it and\\nnever be able to get enough of it. She said that six hours of Wagner was\\nby no means too much. She said that this composer had made a complete\\nrevolution in music and was burying the old masters one by one. And\\nshe said that Wagner\\'s operas differed from all others in one notable\\nrespect, and that was that they were not merely spotted with music here\\nand there, but were _all_ music, from the first strain to the last. This\\nsurprised me. I said I had attended one of his insurrections, and found\\nhardly _any_ music in it except the Wedding Chorus. She said \"Lohengrin\"\\nwas noisier than Wagner\\'s other operas, but that if I would keep on\\ngoing to see it I would find by and by that it was all music, and\\ntherefore would then enjoy it. I _could_ have said, \"But would you\\nadvise a person to deliberately practice having a toothache in the pit\\nof his stomach for a couple of years in order that he might then come to\\nenjoy it?\" But I reserved that remark.\\n\\nThis lady was full of the praises of the head-tenor who had performed in\\na Wagner opera the night before, and went on to enlarge upon his old and\\nprodigious fame, and how many honors had been lavished upon him by the\\nprincely houses of Germany. Here was another surprise. I had attended\\nthat very opera, in the person of my agent, and had made close and\\naccurate observations. So I said:\\n\\n\"Why, madam, _my_ experience warrants me in stating that that tenor\\'s\\nvoice is not a voice at all, but only a shriek--the shriek of a hyena.\"\\n\\n\"That is very true,\" she said; \"he cannot sing now; it is already many\\nyears that he has lost his voice, but in other times he sang, yes,\\ndivinely! So whenever he comes now, you shall see, yes, that the theater\\nwill not hold the people. _Jawohl bei Gott!_ his voice is _wunderschoen_\\nin that past time.\"\\n\\nI said she was discovering to me a kindly trait in the Germans which\\nwas worth emulating. I said that over the water we were not quite so\\ngenerous; that with us, when a singer had lost his voice and a jumper\\nhad lost his legs, these parties ceased to draw. I said I had been to\\nthe opera in Hanover, once, and in Mannheim once, and in Munich\\n(through my authorized agent) once, and this large experience had nearly\\npersuaded me that the Germans _preferred_ singers who couldn\\'t sing.\\nThis was not such a very extravagant speech, either, for that burly\\nMannheim tenor\\'s praises had been the talk of all Heidelberg for a\\nweek before his performance took place--yet his voice was like the\\ndistressing noise which a nail makes when you screech it across a\\nwindow-pane. I said so to Heidelberg friends the next day, and they\\nsaid, in the calmest and simplest way, that that was very true, but that\\nin earlier times his voice _had_ been wonderfully fine. And the tenor\\nin Hanover was just another example of this sort. The English-speaking\\nGerman gentleman who went with me to the opera there was brimming with\\nenthusiasm over that tenor. He said:\\n\\n\"_Ach Gott!_ a great man! You shall see him. He is so celebrate in all\\nGermany--and he has a pension, yes, from the government. He not obliged\\nto sing now, only twice every year; but if he not sing twice each year\\nthey take him his pension away.\"\\n\\nVery well, we went. When the renowned old tenor appeared, I got a nudge\\nand an excited whisper:\\n\\n\"Now you see him!\"\\n\\nBut the \"celebrate\" was an astonishing disappointment to me. If he\\nhad been behind a screen I should have supposed they were performing a\\nsurgical operation on him. I looked at my friend--to my great surprise\\nhe seemed intoxicated with pleasure, his eyes were dancing with eager\\ndelight. When the curtain at last fell, he burst into the stormiest\\napplause, and kept it up--as did the whole house--until the afflictive\\ntenor had come three times before the curtain to make his bow. While the\\nglowing enthusiast was swabbing the perspiration from his face, I said:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mean the least harm, but really, now, do you think he can\\nsing?\"\\n\\n\"Him? _No! Gott im Himmel, aber_, how he has been able to sing\\ntwenty-five years ago?\" [Then pensively.] \"_Ach_, no, _now_ he not sing\\nany more, he only cry. When he think he sing, now, he not sing at all,\\nno, he only make like a cat which is unwell.\"\\n\\nWhere and how did we get the idea that the Germans are a stolid,\\nphlegmatic race? In truth, they are widely removed from that. They are\\nwarm-hearted, emotional, impulsive, enthusiastic, their tears come at\\nthe mildest touch, and it is not hard to move them to laughter. They are\\nthe very children of impulse. We are cold and self-contained, compared\\nto the Germans. They hug and kiss and cry and shout and dance and sing;\\nand where we use one loving, petting expression, they pour out a score.\\nTheir language is full of endearing diminutives; nothing that they love\\nescapes the application of a petting diminutive--neither the house, nor\\nthe dog, nor the horse, nor the grandmother, nor any other creature,\\nanimate or inanimate.\\n\\nIn the theaters at Hanover, Hamburg, and Mannheim, they had a wise\\ncustom. The moment the curtain went up, the light in the body of the\\nhouse went down. The audience sat in the cool gloom of a deep twilight,\\nwhich greatly enhanced the glowing splendors of the stage. It saved gas,\\ntoo, and people were not sweated to death.\\n\\nWhen I saw \"King Lear\" played, nobody was allowed to see a scene\\nshifted; if there was nothing to be done but slide a forest out of the\\nway and expose a temple beyond, one did not see that forest split itself\\nin the middle and go shrieking away, with the accompanying disenchanting\\nspectacle of the hands and heels of the impelling impulse--no, the\\ncurtain was always dropped for an instant--one heard not the least\\nmovement behind it--but when it went up, the next instant, the forest\\nwas gone. Even when the stage was being entirely reset, one heard no\\nnoise. During the whole time that \"King Lear\" was playing the curtain\\nwas never down two minutes at any one time. The orchestra played until\\nthe curtain was ready to go up for the first time, then they departed\\nfor the evening. Where the stage waits never reach two minutes there is\\nno occasion for music. I had never seen this two-minute business between\\nacts but once before, and that was when the \"Shaughraun\" was played at\\nWallack\\'s.\\n\\nI was at a concert in Munich one night, the people were streaming in,\\nthe clock-hand pointed to seven, the music struck up, and instantly\\nall movement in the body of the house ceased--nobody was standing, or\\nwalking up the aisles, or fumbling with a seat, the stream of incomers\\nhad suddenly dried up at its source. I listened undisturbed to a piece\\nof music that was fifteen minutes long--always expecting some tardy\\nticket-holders to come crowding past my knees, and being continuously\\nand pleasantly disappointed--but when the last note was struck, here\\ncame the stream again. You see, they had made those late comers wait in\\nthe comfortable waiting-parlor from the time the music had begun until\\nit was ended.\\n\\nIt was the first time I had ever seen this sort of criminals denied the\\nprivilege of destroying the comfort of a house full of their betters.\\nSome of these were pretty fine birds, but no matter, they had to tarry\\noutside in the long parlor under the inspection of a double rank of\\nliveried footmen and waiting-maids who supported the two walls with\\ntheir backs and held the wraps and traps of their masters and mistresses\\non their arms.\\n\\nWe had no footmen to hold our things, and it was not permissible to take\\nthem into the concert-room; but there were some men and women to take\\ncharge of them for us. They gave us checks for them and charged a fixed\\nprice, payable in advance--five cents.\\n\\nIn Germany they always hear one thing at an opera which has never yet\\nbeen heard in America, perhaps--I mean the closing strain of a fine solo\\nor duet. We always smash into it with an earthquake of applause. The\\nresult is that we rob ourselves of the sweetest part of the treat; we\\nget the whiskey, but we don\\'t get the sugar in the bottom of the glass.\\n\\nOur way of scattering applause along through an act seems to me to be\\nbetter than the Mannheim way of saving it all up till the act is ended.\\nI do not see how an actor can forget himself and portray hot passion\\nbefore a cold still audience. I should think he would feel foolish. It\\nis a pain to me to this day, to remember how that old German Lear raged\\nand wept and howled around the stage, with never a response from that\\nhushed house, never a single outburst till the act was ended. To\\nme there was something unspeakably uncomfortable in the solemn dead\\nsilences that always followed this old person\\'s tremendous outpourings\\nof his feelings. I could not help putting myself in his place--I thought\\nI knew how sick and flat he felt during those silences, because I\\nremembered a case which came under my observation once, and which--but I\\nwill tell the incident:\\n\\nOne evening on board a Mississippi steamboat, a boy of ten years lay\\nasleep in a berth--a long, slim-legged boy, he was, encased in quite\\na short shirt; it was the first time he had ever made a trip on a\\nsteamboat, and so he was troubled, and scared, and had gone to bed\\nwith his head filled with impending snaggings, and explosions, and\\nconflagrations, and sudden death. About ten o\\'clock some twenty ladies\\nwere sitting around about the ladies\\' saloon, quietly reading, sewing,\\nembroidering, and so on, and among them sat a sweet, benignant old dame\\nwith round spectacles on her nose and her busy knitting-needles in her\\nhands. Now all of a sudden, into the midst of this peaceful scene burst\\nthat slim-shanked boy in the brief shirt, wild-eyed, erect-haired, and\\nshouting, \"Fire, fire! _Jump and run, the boat\\'s afire and there ain\\'t a\\nminute to lose!_\" All those ladies looked sweetly up and smiled, nobody\\nstirred, the old lady pulled her spectacles down, looked over them, and\\nsaid, gently:\\n\\n\"But you mustn\\'t catch cold, child. Run and put on your breastpin, and\\nthen come and tell us all about it.\"\\n\\nIt was a cruel chill to give to a poor little devil\\'s gushing vehemence.\\nHe was expecting to be a sort of hero--the creator of a wild panic--and\\nhere everybody sat and smiled a mocking smile, and an old woman made fun\\nof his bugbear. I turned and crept away--for I was that boy--and never\\neven cared to discover whether I had dreamed the fire or actually seen\\nit.\\n\\nI am told that in a German concert or opera, they hardly ever encore\\na song; that though they may be dying to hear it again, their good\\nbreeding usually preserves them against requiring the repetition.\\n\\nKings may encore; that is quite another matter; it delights everybody to\\nsee that the King is pleased; and as to the actor encored, his pride and\\ngratification are simply boundless. Still, there are circumstances in\\nwhich even a royal encore--\\n\\nBut it is better to illustrate. The King of Bavaria is a poet, and has a\\npoet\\'s eccentricities--with the advantage over all other poets of being\\nable to gratify them, no matter what form they may take. He is fond\\nof opera, but not fond of sitting in the presence of an audience;\\ntherefore, it has sometimes occurred, in Munich, that when an opera has\\nbeen concluded and the players were getting off their paint and finery,\\na command has come to them to get their paint and finery on again.\\nPresently the King would arrive, solitary and alone, and the players\\nwould begin at the beginning and do the entire opera over again with\\nonly that one individual in the vast solemn theater for audience. Once\\nhe took an odd freak into his head. High up and out of sight, over\\nthe prodigious stage of the court theater is a maze of interlacing\\nwater-pipes, so pierced that in case of fire, innumerable little\\nthread-like streams of water can be caused to descend; and in case\\nof need, this discharge can be augmented to a pouring flood. American\\nmanagers might want to make a note of that. The King was sole audience.\\nThe opera proceeded, it was a piece with a storm in it; the mimic\\nthunder began to mutter, the mimic wind began to wail and sough, and\\nthe mimic rain to patter. The King\\'s interest rose higher and higher; it\\ndeveloped into enthusiasm. He cried out:\\n\\n\"It is very, very good, indeed! But I will have real rain! Turn on the\\nwater!\"\\n\\nThe manager pleaded for a reversal of the command; said it would ruin\\nthe costly scenery and the splendid costumes, but the King cried:\\n\\n\"No matter, no matter, I will have real rain! Turn on the water!\"\\n\\nSo the real rain was turned on and began to descend in gossamer lances\\nto the mimic flower-beds and gravel walks of the stage. The richly\\ndressed actresses and actors tripped about singing bravely and\\npretending not to mind it. The King was delighted--his enthusiasm grew\\nhigher. He cried out:\\n\\n\"Bravo, bravo! More thunder! more lightning! turn on more rain!\"\\n\\nThe thunder boomed, the lightning glared, the storm-winds raged, the\\ndeluge poured down. The mimic royalty on the stage, with their soaked\\nsatins clinging to their bodies, slopped about ankle-deep in water,\\nwarbling their sweetest and best, the fiddlers under the eaves of the\\nstage sawed away for dear life, with the cold overflow spouting down the\\nbacks of their necks, and the dry and happy King sat in his lofty box\\nand wore his gloves to ribbons applauding.\\n\\n\"More yet!\" cried the King; \"more yet--let loose all the thunder, turn\\non all the water! I will hang the man that raises an umbrella!\"\\n\\nWhen this most tremendous and effective storm that had ever been\\nproduced in any theater was at last over, the King\\'s approbation was\\nmeasureless. He cried:\\n\\n\"Magnificent, magnificent! _Encore_! Do it again!\"\\n\\nBut the manager succeeded in persuading him to recall the encore, and\\nsaid the company would feel sufficiently rewarded and complimented\\nin the mere fact that the encore was desired by his Majesty, without\\nfatiguing him with a repetition to gratify their own vanity.\\n\\nDuring the remainder of the act the lucky performers were those whose\\nparts required changes of dress; the others were a soaked, bedraggled,\\nand uncomfortable lot, but in the last degree picturesque. The stage\\nscenery was ruined, trap-doors were so swollen that they wouldn\\'t work\\nfor a week afterward, the fine costumes were spoiled, and no end of\\nminor damages were done by that remarkable storm.\\n\\nIt was a royal idea--that storm--and royally carried out. But observe\\nthe moderation of the King; he did not insist upon his encore. If he had\\nbeen a gladsome, unreflecting American opera-audience, he probably would\\nhave had his storm repeated and repeated until he drowned all those\\npeople.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XI\\n\\n[I Paint a \"Turner\"]\\n\\nThe summer days passed pleasantly in Heidelberg. We had a skilled\\ntrainer, and under his instructions we were getting our legs in the\\nright condition for the contemplated pedestrian tours; we were well\\nsatisfied with the progress which we had made in the German language,\\n[1. See Appendix D for information concerning this fearful tongue.] and\\nmore than satisfied with what we had accomplished in art. We had had the\\nbest instructors in drawing and painting in Germany--Haemmerling, Vogel,\\nMueller, Dietz, and Schumann. Haemmerling taught us landscape-painting.\\nVogel taught us figure-drawing, Mueller taught us to do still-life,\\nand Dietz and Schumann gave us a finishing course in two\\nspecialties--battle-pieces and shipwrecks. Whatever I am in Art I owe to\\nthese men. I have something of the manner of each and all of them;\\nbut they all said that I had also a manner of my own, and that it\\nwas conspicuous. They said there was a marked individuality about my\\nstyle--insomuch that if I ever painted the commonest type of a dog, I\\nshould be sure to throw a something into the aspect of that dog which\\nwould keep him from being mistaken for the creation of any other artist.\\nSecretly I wanted to believe all these kind sayings, but I could not; I\\nwas afraid that my masters\\' partiality for me, and pride in me, biased\\ntheir judgment. So I resolved to make a test. Privately, and unknown to\\nany one, I painted my great picture, \"Heidelberg Castle Illuminated\"--my\\nfirst really important work in oils--and had it hung up in the midst\\nof a wilderness of oil-pictures in the Art Exhibition, with no name\\nattached to it. To my great gratification it was instantly recognized\\nas mine. All the town flocked to see it, and people even came from\\nneighboring localities to visit it. It made more stir than any other\\nwork in the Exhibition. But the most gratifying thing of all was, that\\nchance strangers, passing through, who had not heard of my picture, were\\nnot only drawn to it, as by a lodestone, the moment they entered the\\ngallery, but always took it for a \"Turner.\"\\n\\nApparently nobody had ever done that. There were ruined castles on the\\noverhanging cliffs and crags all the way; these were said to have their\\nlegends, like those on the Rhine, and what was better still, they had\\nnever been in print. There was nothing in the books about that lovely\\nregion; it had been neglected by the tourist, it was virgin soil for the\\nliterary pioneer.\\n\\nMeantime the knapsacks, the rough walking-suits and the stout\\nwalking-shoes which we had ordered, were finished and brought to us.\\nA Mr. X and a young Mr. Z had agreed to go with us. We went around one\\nevening and bade good-by to our friends, and afterward had a little\\nfarewell banquet at the hotel. We got to bed early, for we wanted to\\nmake an early start, so as to take advantage of the cool of the morning.\\n\\nWe were out of bed at break of day, feeling fresh and vigorous, and took\\na hearty breakfast, then plunged down through the leafy arcades of the\\nCastle grounds, toward the town. What a glorious summer morning it was,\\nand how the flowers did pour out their fragrance, and how the birds did\\nsing! It was just the time for a tramp through the woods and mountains.\\n\\nWe were all dressed alike: broad slouch hats, to keep the sun off; gray\\nknapsacks; blue army shirts; blue overalls; leathern gaiters buttoned\\ntight from knee down to ankle; high-quarter coarse shoes snugly laced.\\nEach man had an opera-glass, a canteen, and a guide-book case slung over\\nhis shoulder, and carried an alpenstock in one hand and a sun-umbrella\\nin the other. Around our hats were wound many folds of soft white\\nmuslin, with the ends hanging and flapping down our backs--an idea\\nbrought from the Orient and used by tourists all over Europe. Harris\\ncarried the little watch-like machine called a \"pedometer,\" whose\\noffice is to keep count of a man\\'s steps and tell how far he has walked.\\nEverybody stopped to admire our costumes and give us a hearty \"Pleasant\\nmarch to you!\"\\n\\nWhen we got downtown I found that we could go by rail to within five\\nmiles of Heilbronn. The train was just starting, so we jumped aboard and\\nwent tearing away in splendid spirits. It was agreed all around that we\\nhad done wisely, because it would be just as enjoyable to walk _down_\\nthe Neckar as up it, and it could not be needful to walk both ways.\\nThere were some nice German people in our compartment. I got to talking\\nsome pretty private matters presently, and Harris became nervous; so he\\nnudged me and said:\\n\\n\"Speak in German--these Germans may understand English.\"\\n\\nI did so, it was well I did; for it turned out that there was not a\\nGerman in that party who did not understand English perfectly. It is\\ncurious how widespread our language is in Germany. After a while some of\\nthose folks got out and a German gentleman and his two young daughters\\ngot in. I spoke in German of one of the latter several times, but\\nwithout result. Finally she said:\\n\\n\"_Ich verstehe nur deutch und englishe_,\"--or words to that effect. That\\nis, \"I don\\'t understand any language but German and English.\"\\n\\nAnd sure enough, not only she but her father and sister spoke English.\\nSo after that we had all the talk we wanted; and we wanted a good deal,\\nfor they were agreeable people. They were greatly interested in our\\ncustoms; especially the alpenstocks, for they had not seen any before.\\nThey said that the Neckar road was perfectly level, so we must be going\\nto Switzerland or some other rugged country; and asked us if we did not\\nfind the walking pretty fatiguing in such warm weather. But we said no.\\n\\nWe reached Wimpfen--I think it was Wimpfen--in about three hours, and\\ngot out, not the least tired; found a good hotel and ordered beer and\\ndinner--then took a stroll through the venerable old village. It was\\nvery picturesque and tumble-down, and dirty and interesting. It had\\nqueer houses five hundred years old in it, and a military tower 115 feet\\nhigh, which had stood there more than ten centuries. I made a little\\nsketch of it. I kept a copy, but gave the original to the Burgomaster.\\n\\nI think the original was better than the copy, because it had more\\nwindows in it and the grass stood up better and had a brisker look.\\nThere was none around the tower, though; I composed the grass myself,\\nfrom studies I made in a field by Heidelberg in Haemmerling\\'s time. The\\nman on top, looking at the view, is apparently too large, but I found\\nhe could not be made smaller, conveniently. I wanted him there, and I\\nwanted him visible, so I thought out a way to manage it; I composed the\\npicture from two points of view; the spectator is to observe the man\\nfrom bout where that flag is, and he must observe the tower itself from\\nthe ground. This harmonizes the seeming discrepancy. [Figure 2]\\n\\nNear an old cathedral, under a shed, were three crosses of stone--moldy\\nand damaged things, bearing life-size stone figures. The two thieves\\nwere dressed in the fanciful court costumes of the middle of the\\nsixteenth century, while the Saviour was nude, with the exception of a\\ncloth around the loins.\\n\\nWe had dinner under the green trees in a garden belonging to the hotel\\nand overlooking the Neckar; then, after a smoke, we went to bed. We had\\na refreshing nap, then got up about three in the afternoon and put\\non our panoply. As we tramped gaily out at the gate of the town, we\\novertook a peasant\\'s cart, partly laden with odds and ends of cabbages\\nand similar vegetable rubbish, and drawn by a small cow and a smaller\\ndonkey yoked together. It was a pretty slow concern, but it got us into\\nHeilbronn before dark--five miles, or possibly it was seven.\\n\\nWe stopped at the very same inn which the famous old robber-knight\\nand rough fighter Goetz von Berlichingen, abode in after he got out of\\ncaptivity in the Square Tower of Heilbronn between three hundred and\\nfifty and four hundred years ago. Harris and I occupied the same room\\nwhich he had occupied and the same paper had not quite peeled off the\\nwalls yet. The furniture was quaint old carved stuff, full four hundred\\nyears old, and some of the smells were over a thousand. There was a hook\\nin the wall, which the landlord said the terrific old Goetz used to hang\\nhis iron hand on when he took it off to go to bed. This room was very\\nlarge--it might be called immense--and it was on the first floor; which\\nmeans it was in the second story, for in Europe the houses are so\\nhigh that they do not count the first story, else they would get tired\\nclimbing before they got to the top. The wallpaper was a fiery red, with\\nhuge gold figures in it, well smirched by time, and it covered all the\\ndoors. These doors fitted so snugly and continued the figures of the\\npaper so unbrokenly, that when they were closed one had to go feeling\\nand searching along the wall to find them. There was a stove in the\\ncorner--one of those tall, square, stately white porcelain things that\\nlooks like a monument and keeps you thinking of death when you ought to\\nbe enjoying your travels. The windows looked out on a little alley, and\\nover that into a stable and some poultry and pig yards in the rear of\\nsome tenement-houses. There were the customary two beds in the room,\\none in one end, the other in the other, about an old-fashioned\\nbrass-mounted, single-barreled pistol-shot apart. They were fully\\nas narrow as the usual German bed, too, and had the German bed\\'s\\nineradicable habit of spilling the blankets on the floor every time you\\nforgot yourself and went to sleep.\\n\\nA round table as large as King Arthur\\'s stood in the center of the room;\\nwhile the waiters were getting ready to serve our dinner on it we\\nall went out to see the renowned clock on the front of the municipal\\nbuildings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\n[What the Wives Saved]\\n\\nThe _Rathhaus_, or municipal building, is of the quaintest and most\\npicturesque Middle-Age architecture. It has a massive portico and steps,\\nbefore it, heavily balustraded, and adorned with life-sized rusty iron\\nknights in complete armor. The clock-face on the front of the building\\nis very large and of curious pattern. Ordinarily, a gilded angel\\nstrikes the hour on a big bell with a hammer; as the striking ceases, a\\nlife-sized figure of Time raises its hour-glass and turns it; two golden\\nrams advance and butt each other; a gilded cock lifts its wings; but the\\nmain features are two great angels, who stand on each side of the dial\\nwith long horns at their lips; it was said that they blew melodious\\nblasts on these horns every hour--but they did not do it for us. We were\\ntold, later, that they blew only at night, when the town was still.\\n\\nWithin the _Rathhaus_ were a number of huge wild boars\\' heads,\\npreserved, and mounted on brackets along the wall; they bore\\ninscriptions telling who killed them and how many hundred years ago it\\nwas done. One room in the building was devoted to the preservation of\\nancient archives. There they showed us no end of aged documents; some\\nwere signed by Popes, some by Tilly and other great generals, and\\none was a letter written and subscribed by Goetz von Berlichingen in\\nHeilbronn in 1519 just after his release from the Square Tower.\\n\\nThis fine old robber-knight was a devoutly and sincerely religious\\nman, hospitable, charitable to the poor, fearless in fight, active,\\nenterprising, and possessed of a large and generous nature. He had in\\nhim a quality of being able to overlook moderate injuries, and being\\nable to forgive and forget mortal ones as soon as he had soundly\\ntrounced the authors of them. He was prompt to take up any poor devil\\'s\\nquarrel and risk his neck to right him. The common folk held him dear,\\nand his memory is still green in ballad and tradition. He used to go on\\nthe highway and rob rich wayfarers; and other times he would swoop down\\nfrom his high castle on the hills of the Neckar and capture passing\\ncargoes of merchandise. In his memoirs he piously thanks the Giver of\\nall Good for remembering him in his needs and delivering sundry such\\ncargoes into his hands at times when only special providences could have\\nrelieved him. He was a doughty warrior and found a deep joy in battle.\\nIn an assault upon a stronghold in Bavaria when he was only twenty-three\\nyears old, his right hand was shot away, but he was so interested in the\\nfight that he did not observe it for a while. He said that the iron hand\\nwhich was made for him afterward, and which he wore for more than half a\\ncentury, was nearly as clever a member as the fleshy one had been. I was\\nglad to get a facsimile of the letter written by this fine old German\\nRobin Hood, though I was not able to read it. He was a better artist\\nwith his sword than with his pen.\\n\\nWe went down by the river and saw the Square Tower. It was a very\\nvenerable structure, very strong, and very ornamental. There was no\\nopening near the ground. They had to use a ladder to get into it, no\\ndoubt.\\n\\nWe visited the principal church, also--a curious old structure, with a\\ntowerlike spire adorned with all sorts of grotesque images. The inner\\nwalls of the church were placarded with large mural tablets of copper,\\nbearing engraved inscriptions celebrating the merits of old Heilbronn\\nworthies of two or three centuries ago, and also bearing rudely painted\\neffigies of themselves and their families tricked out in the queer\\ncostumes of those days. The head of the family sat in the foreground,\\nand beyond him extended a sharply receding and diminishing row of\\nsons; facing him sat his wife, and beyond her extended a low row of\\ndiminishing daughters. The family was usually large, but the perspective\\nbad.\\n\\nThen we hired the hack and the horse which Goetz von Berlichingen used\\nto use, and drove several miles into the country to visit the place\\ncalled _Weibertreu_--Wife\\'s Fidelity I suppose it means. It was a feudal\\ncastle of the Middle Ages. When we reached its neighborhood we found\\nit was beautifully situated, but on top of a mound, or hill, round and\\ntolerably steep, and about two hundred feet high. Therefore, as the sun\\nwas blazing hot, we did not climb up there, but took the place on trust,\\nand observed it from a distance while the horse leaned up against a\\nfence and rested. The place has no interest except that which is lent it\\nby its legend, which is a very pretty one--to this effect:\\n\\nTHE LEGEND\\n\\nIn the Middle Ages, a couple of young dukes, brothers, took opposite\\nsides in one of the wars, the one fighting for the Emperor, the other\\nagainst him. One of them owned the castle and village on top of the\\nmound which I have been speaking of, and in his absence his brother\\ncame with his knights and soldiers and began a siege. It was a long and\\ntedious business, for the people made a stubborn and faithful defense.\\nBut at last their supplies ran out and starvation began its work;\\nmore fell by hunger than by the missiles of the enemy. They by and\\nby surrendered, and begged for charitable terms. But the beleaguering\\nprince was so incensed against them for their long resistance that he\\nsaid he would spare none but the women and children--all men should be\\nput to the sword without exception, and all their goods destroyed. Then\\nthe women came and fell on their knees and begged for the lives of their\\nhusbands.\\n\\n\"No,\" said the prince, \"not a man of them shall escape alive; you\\nyourselves shall go with your children into houseless and friendless\\nbanishment; but that you may not starve I grant you this one grace,\\nthat each woman may bear with her from this place as much of her most\\nvaluable property as she is able to carry.\"\\n\\nVery well, presently the gates swung open and out filed those women\\ncarrying their _husbands_ on their shoulders. The besiegers, furious\\nat the trick, rushed forward to slaughter the men, but the Duke stepped\\nbetween and said:\\n\\n\"No, put up your swords--a prince\\'s word is inviolable.\"\\n\\nWhen we got back to the hotel, King Arthur\\'s Round Table was ready for\\nus in its white drapery, and the head waiter and his first assistant, in\\nswallow-tails and white cravats, brought in the soup and the hot plates\\nat once.\\n\\nMr. X had ordered the dinner, and when the wine came on, he picked up\\na bottle, glanced at the label, and then turned to the grave, the\\nmelancholy, the sepulchral head waiter and said it was not the sort of\\nwine he had asked for. The head waiter picked up the bottle, cast his\\nundertaker-eye on it and said:\\n\\n\"It is true; I beg pardon.\" Then he turned on his subordinate and calmly\\nsaid, \"Bring another label.\"\\n\\nAt the same time he slid the present label off with his hand and laid it\\naside; it had been newly put on, its paste was still wet. When the new\\nlabel came, he put it on; our French wine being now turned into German\\nwine, according to desire, the head waiter went blandly about his other\\nduties, as if the working of this sort of miracle was a common and easy\\nthing to him.\\n\\nMr. X said he had not known, before, that there were people honest\\nenough to do this miracle in public, but he was aware that thousands\\nupon thousands of labels were imported into America from Europe every\\nyear, to enable dealers to furnish to their customers in a quiet and\\ninexpensive way all the different kinds of foreign wines they might\\nrequire.\\n\\nWe took a turn around the town, after dinner, and found it fully as\\ninteresting in the moonlight as it had been in the daytime. The streets\\nwere narrow and roughly paved, and there was not a sidewalk or a\\nstreet-lamp anywhere. The dwellings were centuries old, and vast enough\\nfor hotels. They widened all the way up; the stories projected further\\nand further forward and aside as they ascended, and the long rows\\nof lighted windows, filled with little bits of panes, curtained with\\nfigured white muslin and adorned outside with boxes of flowers, made a\\npretty effect.\\n\\nThe moon was bright, and the light and shadow very strong; and nothing\\ncould be more picturesque than those curving streets, with their rows\\nof huge high gables leaning far over toward each other in a friendly\\ngossiping way, and the crowds below drifting through the alternating\\nblots of gloom and mellow bars of moonlight. Nearly everybody was\\nabroad, chatting, singing, romping, or massed in lazy comfortable\\nattitudes in the doorways.\\n\\nIn one place there was a public building which was fenced about with a\\nthick, rusty chain, which sagged from post to post in a succession of\\nlow swings. The pavement, here, was made of heavy blocks of stone. In\\nthe glare of the moon a party of barefooted children were swinging on\\nthose chains and having a noisy good time. They were not the first ones\\nwho have done that; even their great-great-grandfathers had not been the\\nfirst to do it when they were children. The strokes of the bare feet\\nhad worn grooves inches deep in the stone flags; it had taken many\\ngenerations of swinging children to accomplish that.\\n\\nEverywhere in the town were the mold and decay that go with antiquity,\\nand evidence of it; but I do not know that anything else gave us so\\nvivid a sense of the old age of Heilbronn as those footworn grooves in\\nthe paving-stones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\n[My Long Crawl in the Dark]\\n\\nWhen we got back to the hotel I wound and set the pedometer and put\\nit in my pocket, for I was to carry it next day and keep record of the\\nmiles we made. The work which we had given the instrument to do during\\nthe day which had just closed had not fatigued it perceptibly.\\n\\nWe were in bed by ten, for we wanted to be up and away on our tramp\\nhomeward with the dawn. I hung fire, but Harris went to sleep at once.\\nI hate a man who goes to sleep at once; there is a sort of indefinable\\nsomething about it which is not exactly an insult, and yet is an\\ninsolence; and one which is hard to bear, too. I lay there fretting\\nover this injury, and trying to go to sleep; but the harder I tried, the\\nwider awake I grew. I got to feeling very lonely in the dark, with no\\ncompany but an undigested dinner. My mind got a start by and by, and\\nbegan to consider the beginning of every subject which has ever been\\nthought of; but it never went further than the beginning; it was touch\\nand go; it fled from topic to topic with a frantic speed. At the end of\\nan hour my head was in a perfect whirl and I was dead tired, fagged out.\\n\\nThe fatigue was so great that it presently began to make some head\\nagainst the nervous excitement; while imagining myself wide awake, I\\nwould really doze into momentary unconsciousness, and come suddenly out\\nof it with a physical jerk which nearly wrenched my joints apart--the\\ndelusion of the instant being that I was tumbling backward over a\\nprecipice. After I had fallen over eight or nine precipices and thus\\nfound out that one half of my brain had been asleep eight or nine times\\nwithout the wide-awake, hard-working other half suspecting it, the\\nperiodical unconsciousnesses began to extend their spell gradually over\\nmore of my brain-territory, and at last I sank into a drowse which grew\\ndeeper and deeper and was doubtless just on the very point of being a\\nsolid, blessed dreamless stupor, when--what was that?\\n\\nMy dulled faculties dragged themselves partly back to life and took a\\nreceptive attitude. Now out of an immense, a limitless distance, came\\na something which grew and grew, and approached, and presently was\\nrecognizable as a sound--it had rather seemed to be a feeling, before.\\nThis sound was a mile away, now--perhaps it was the murmur of a storm;\\nand now it was nearer--not a quarter of a mile away; was it the muffled\\nrasping and grinding of distant machinery? No, it came still nearer; was\\nit the measured tramp of a marching troop? But it came nearer still,\\nand still nearer--and at last it was right in the room: it was merely\\na mouse gnawing the woodwork. So I had held my breath all that time for\\nsuch a trifle.\\n\\nWell, what was done could not be helped; I would go to sleep at once and\\nmake up the lost time. That was a thoughtless thought. Without intending\\nit--hardly knowing it--I fell to listening intently to that sound, and\\neven unconsciously counting the strokes of the mouse\\'s nutmeg-grater.\\nPresently I was deriving exquisite suffering from this employment, yet\\nmaybe I could have endured it if the mouse had attended steadily to\\nhis work; but he did not do that; he stopped every now and then, and I\\nsuffered more while waiting and listening for him to begin again than\\nI did while he was gnawing. Along at first I was mentally offering a\\nreward of five--six--seven--ten--dollars for that mouse; but toward\\nthe last I was offering rewards which were entirely beyond my means. I\\nclose-reefed my ears--that is to say, I bent the flaps of them down\\nand furled them into five or six folds, and pressed them against the\\nhearing-orifice--but it did no good: the faculty was so sharpened\\nby nervous excitement that it was become a microphone and could hear\\nthrough the overlays without trouble.\\n\\nMy anger grew to a frenzy. I finally did what all persons before me have\\ndone, clear back to Adam,--resolved to throw something. I reached down\\nand got my walking-shoes, then sat up in bed and listened, in order to\\nexactly locate the noise. But I couldn\\'t do it; it was as unlocatable as\\na cricket\\'s noise; and where one thinks that that is, is always the very\\nplace where it isn\\'t. So I presently hurled a shoe at random, and with\\na vicious vigor. It struck the wall over Harris\\'s head and fell down on\\nhim; I had not imagined I could throw so far. It woke Harris, and I was\\nglad of it until I found he was not angry; then I was sorry. He soon\\nwent to sleep again, which pleased me; but straightway the mouse began\\nagain, which roused my temper once more. I did not want to wake Harris\\na second time, but the gnawing continued until I was compelled to throw\\nthe other shoe.\\n\\nThis time I broke a mirror--there were two in the room--I got the\\nlargest one, of course. Harris woke again, but did not complain, and\\nI was sorrier than ever. I resolved that I would suffer all possible\\ntorture before I would disturb him a third time.\\n\\nThe mouse eventually retired, and by and by I was sinking to sleep, when\\na clock began to strike; I counted till it was done, and was about to\\ndrowse again when another clock began; I counted; then the two great\\n_Rathhaus_ clock angels began to send forth soft, rich, melodious blasts\\nfrom their long trumpets. I had never heard anything that was so lovely,\\nor weird, or mysterious--but when they got to blowing the quarter-hours,\\nthey seemed to me to be overdoing the thing. Every time I dropped\\noff for the moment, a new noise woke me. Each time I woke I missed my\\ncoverlet, and had to reach down to the floor and get it again.\\n\\nAt last all sleepiness forsook me. I recognized the fact that I was\\nhopelessly and permanently wide awake. Wide awake, and feverish and\\nthirsty. When I had lain tossing there as long as I could endure it, it\\noccurred to me that it would be a good idea to dress and go out in the\\ngreat square and take a refreshing wash in the fountain, and smoke and\\nreflect there until the remnant of the night was gone.\\n\\nI believed I could dress in the dark without waking Harris. I had\\nbanished my shoes after the mouse, but my slippers would do for a summer\\nnight. So I rose softly, and gradually got on everything--down to one\\nsock. I couldn\\'t seem to get on the track of that sock, any way I could\\nfix it. But I had to have it; so I went down on my hands and knees, with\\none slipper on and the other in my hand, and began to paw gently around\\nand rake the floor, but with no success. I enlarged my circle, and went\\non pawing and raking. With every pressure of my knee, how the floor\\ncreaked! and every time I chanced to rake against any article, it seemed\\nto give out thirty-five or thirty-six times more noise than it would\\nhave done in the daytime. In those cases I always stopped and held\\nmy breath till I was sure Harris had not awakened--then I crept along\\nagain. I moved on and on, but I could not find the sock; I could not\\nseem to find anything but furniture. I could not remember that there was\\nmuch furniture in the room when I went to bed, but the place was alive\\nwith it now--especially chairs--chairs everywhere--had a couple of\\nfamilies moved in, in the mean time? And I never could seem to _glance_\\non one of those chairs, but always struck it full and square with my\\nhead. My temper rose, by steady and sure degrees, and as I pawed on and\\non, I fell to making vicious comments under my breath.\\n\\nFinally, with a venomous access of irritation, I said I would leave\\nwithout the sock; so I rose up and made straight for the door--as I\\nsupposed--and suddenly confronted my dim spectral image in the unbroken\\nmirror. It startled the breath out of me, for an instant; it also showed\\nme that I was lost, and had no sort of idea where I was. When I realized\\nthis, I was so angry that I had to sit down on the floor and take hold\\nof something to keep from lifting the roof off with an explosion of\\nopinion. If there had been only one mirror, it might possibly have\\nhelped to locate me; but there were two, and two were as bad as a\\nthousand; besides, these were on opposite sides of the room. I could see\\nthe dim blur of the windows, but in my turned-around condition they were\\nexactly where they ought not to be, and so they only confused me instead\\nof helping me.\\n\\nI started to get up, and knocked down an umbrella; it made a noise\\nlike a pistol-shot when it struck that hard, slick, carpetless floor;\\nI grated my teeth and held my breath--Harris did not stir. I set the\\numbrella slowly and carefully on end against the wall, but as soon as\\nI took my hand away, its heel slipped from under it, and down it came\\nagain with another bang. I shrunk together and listened a moment in\\nsilent fury--no harm done, everything quiet. With the most painstaking\\ncare and nicety, I stood the umbrella up once more, took my hand away,\\nand down it came again.\\n\\nI have been strictly reared, but if it had not been so dark and solemn\\nand awful there in that lonely, vast room, I do believe I should have\\nsaid something then which could not be put into a Sunday-school book\\nwithout injuring the sale of it. If my reasoning powers had not been\\nalready sapped dry by my harassments, I would have known better than to\\ntry to set an umbrella on end on one of those glassy German floors in\\nthe dark; it can\\'t be done in the daytime without four failures to one\\nsuccess. I had one comfort, though--Harris was yet still and silent--he\\nhad not stirred.\\n\\nThe umbrella could not locate me--there were four standing around the\\nroom, and all alike. I thought I would feel along the wall and find the\\ndoor in that way. I rose up and began this operation, but raked down\\na picture. It was not a large one, but it made noise enough for a\\npanorama. Harris gave out no sound, but I felt that if I experimented\\nany further with the pictures I should be sure to wake him. Better give\\nup trying to get out. Yes, I would find King Arthur\\'s Round Table once\\nmore--I had already found it several times--and use it for a base of\\ndeparture on an exploring tour for my bed; if I could find my bed I\\ncould then find my water pitcher; I would quench my raging thirst and\\nturn in. So I started on my hands and knees, because I could go faster\\nthat way, and with more confidence, too, and not knock down things. By\\nand by I found the table--with my head--rubbed the bruise a little, then\\nrose up and started, with hands abroad and fingers spread, to balance\\nmyself. I found a chair; then a wall; then another chair; then a sofa;\\nthen an alpenstock, then another sofa; this confounded me, for I had\\nthought there was only one sofa. I hunted up the table again and took a\\nfresh start; found some more chairs.\\n\\nIt occurred to me, now, as it ought to have done before, that as the\\ntable was round, it was therefore of no value as a base to aim from; so\\nI moved off once more, and at random among the wilderness of chairs and\\nsofas--wandering off into unfamiliar regions, and presently knocked a\\ncandlestick and knocked off a lamp, grabbed at the lamp and knocked\\noff a water pitcher with a rattling crash, and thought to myself,\\n\"I\\'ve found you at last--I judged I was close upon you.\" Harris shouted\\n\"murder,\" and \"thieves,\" and finished with \"I\\'m absolutely drowned.\"\\n\\nThe crash had roused the house. Mr. X pranced in, in his long\\nnight-garment, with a candle, young Z after him with another candle; a\\nprocession swept in at another door, with candles and lanterns--landlord\\nand two German guests in their nightgowns and a chambermaid in hers.\\n\\nI looked around; I was at Harris\\'s bed, a Sabbath-day\\'s journey from my\\nown. There was only one sofa; it was against the wall; there was only\\none chair where a body could get at it--I had been revolving around it\\nlike a planet, and colliding with it like a comet half the night.\\n\\nI explained how I had been employing myself, and why. Then the\\nlandlord\\'s party left, and the rest of us set about our preparations for\\nbreakfast, for the dawn was ready to break. I glanced furtively at my\\npedometer, and found I had made 47 miles. But I did not care, for I had\\ncome out for a pedestrian tour anyway.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\n[Rafting Down the Neckar]\\n\\nWhen the landlord learned that I and my agents were artists, our party\\nrose perceptibly in his esteem; we rose still higher when he learned\\nthat we were making a pedestrian tour of Europe.\\n\\nHe told us all about the Heidelberg road, and which were the best places\\nto avoid and which the best ones to tarry at; he charged me less than\\ncost for the things I broke in the night; he put up a fine luncheon\\nfor us and added to it a quantity of great light-green plums, the\\npleasantest fruit in Germany; he was so anxious to do us honor that he\\nwould not allow us to walk out of Heilbronn, but called up Goetz von\\nBerlichingen\\'s horse and cab and made us ride.\\n\\nI made a sketch of the turnout. It is not a Work, it is only what\\nartists call a \"study\"--a thing to make a finished picture from. This\\nsketch has several blemishes in it; for instance, the wagon is not\\ntraveling as fast as the horse is. This is wrong. Again, the person\\ntrying to get out of the way is too small; he is out of perspective,\\nas we say. The two upper lines are not the horse\\'s back, they are the\\nreigns; there seems to be a wheel missing--this would be corrected in a\\nfinished Work, of course. This thing flying out behind is not a flag,\\nit is a curtain. That other thing up there is the sun, but I didn\\'t get\\nenough distance on it. I do not remember, now, what that thing is that\\nis in front of the man who is running, but I think it is a haystack or a\\nwoman. This study was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1879, but did not\\ntake any medal; they do not give medals for studies.\\n\\nWe discharged the carriage at the bridge. The river was full of\\nlogs--long, slender, barkless pine logs--and we leaned on the rails\\nof the bridge, and watched the men put them together into rafts. These\\nrafts were of a shape and construction to suit the crookedness and\\nextreme narrowness of the Neckar. They were from fifty to one hundred\\nyards long, and they gradually tapered from a nine-log breadth at their\\nsterns, to a three-log breadth at their bow-ends. The main part of the\\nsteering is done at the bow, with a pole; the three-log breadth there\\nfurnishes room for only the steersman, for these little logs are not\\nlarger around than an average young lady\\'s waist. The connections of the\\nseveral sections of the raft are slack and pliant, so that the raft\\nmay be readily bent into any sort of curve required by the shape of the\\nriver.\\n\\nThe Neckar is in many places so narrow that a person can throw a dog\\nacross it, if he has one; when it is also sharply curved in such places,\\nthe raftsman has to do some pretty nice snug piloting to make the turns.\\nThe river is not always allowed to spread over its whole bed--which is\\nas much as thirty, and sometimes forty yards wide--but is split into\\nthree equal bodies of water, by stone dikes which throw the main\\nvolume, depth, and current into the central one. In low water these neat\\nnarrow-edged dikes project four or five inches above the surface, like\\nthe comb of a submerged roof, but in high water they are overflowed. A\\nhatful of rain makes high water in the Neckar, and a basketful produces\\nan overflow.\\n\\nThere are dikes abreast the Schloss Hotel, and the current is violently\\nswift at that point. I used to sit for hours in my glass cage, watching\\nthe long, narrow rafts slip along through the central channel, grazing\\nthe right-bank dike and aiming carefully for the middle arch of the\\nstone bridge below; I watched them in this way, and lost all this time\\nhoping to see one of them hit the bridge-pier and wreck itself sometime\\nor other, but was always disappointed. One was smashed there one\\nmorning, but I had just stepped into my room a moment to light a pipe,\\nso I lost it.\\n\\nWhile I was looking down upon the rafts that morning in Heilbronn, the\\ndaredevil spirit of adventure came suddenly upon me, and I said to my\\ncomrades:\\n\\n\"I am going to Heidelberg on a raft. Will you venture with me?\"\\n\\nTheir faces paled a little, but they assented with as good a grace as\\nthey could. Harris wanted to cable his mother--thought it his duty to\\ndo that, as he was all she had in this world--so, while he attended to\\nthis, I went down to the longest and finest raft and hailed the captain\\nwith a hearty \"Ahoy, shipmate!\" which put us upon pleasant terms at\\nonce, and we entered upon business. I said we were on a pedestrian tour\\nto Heidelberg, and would like to take passage with him. I said this\\npartly through young Z, who spoke German very well, and partly through\\nMr. X, who spoke it peculiarly. I can _understand_ German as well as the\\nmaniac that invented it, but I _talk_ it best through an interpreter.\\n\\nThe captain hitched up his trousers, then shifted his quid thoughtfully.\\nPresently he said just what I was expecting he would say--that he had no\\nlicense to carry passengers, and therefore was afraid the law would be\\nafter him in case the matter got noised about or any accident happened.\\nSo I _chartered_ the raft and the crew and took all the responsibilities\\non myself.\\n\\nWith a rattling song the starboard watch bent to their work and hove\\nthe cable short, then got the anchor home, and our bark moved off with a\\nstately stride, and soon was bowling along at about two knots an hour.\\n\\nOur party were grouped amidships. At first the talk was a little gloomy,\\nand ran mainly upon the shortness of life, the uncertainty of it, the\\nperils which beset it, and the need and wisdom of being always prepared\\nfor the worst; this shaded off into low-voiced references to the dangers\\nof the deep, and kindred matters; but as the gray east began to redden\\nand the mysterious solemnity and silence of the dawn to give place\\nto the joy-songs of the birds, the talk took a cheerier tone, and our\\nspirits began to rise steadily.\\n\\nGermany, in the summer, is the perfection of the beautiful, but nobody\\nhas understood, and realized, and enjoyed the utmost possibilities of\\nthis soft and peaceful beauty unless he has voyaged down the Neckar on\\na raft. The motion of a raft is the needful motion; it is gentle,\\nand gliding, and smooth, and noiseless; it calms down all feverish\\nactivities, it soothes to sleep all nervous hurry and impatience; under\\nits restful influence all the troubles and vexations and sorrows that\\nharass the mind vanish away, and existence becomes a dream, a charm,\\na deep and tranquil ecstasy. How it contrasts with hot and perspiring\\npedestrianism, and dusty and deafening railroad rush, and tedious\\njolting behind tired horses over blinding white roads!\\n\\nWe went slipping silently along, between the green and fragrant banks,\\nwith a sense of pleasure and contentment that grew, and grew, all the\\ntime. Sometimes the banks were overhung with thick masses of willows\\nthat wholly hid the ground behind; sometimes we had noble hills on one\\nhand, clothed densely with foliage to their tops, and on the other hand\\nopen levels blazing with poppies, or clothed in the rich blue of\\nthe corn-flower; sometimes we drifted in the shadow of forests, and\\nsometimes along the margin of long stretches of velvety grass, fresh and\\ngreen and bright, a tireless charm to the eye. And the birds!--they were\\neverywhere; they swept back and forth across the river constantly, and\\ntheir jubilant music was never stilled.\\n\\nIt was a deep and satisfying pleasure to see the sun create the new\\nmorning, and gradually, patiently, lovingly, clothe it on with splendor\\nafter splendor, and glory after glory, till the miracle was complete.\\nHow different is this marvel observed from a raft, from what it is when\\none observes it through the dingy windows of a railway-station in some\\nwretched village while he munches a petrified sandwich and waits for the\\ntrain.\\n\\n[Transcriber\\'s Note for edition 12: on the advice of two German-speaking\\nvolunteers, the German letters a, o, and u with umlauts have been\\nrendered as ae, oe, and ue instead of as, variously, :a, a\", :o, o\" and\\n:u, u\" as in previous editions.]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XV\\n\\n[Charming Waterside Pictures]\\n\\nMen and women and cattle were at work in the dewy fields by this time.\\nThe people often stepped aboard the raft, as we glided along the grassy\\nshores, and gossiped with us and with the crew for a hundred yards or\\nso, then stepped ashore again, refreshed by the ride.\\n\\nOnly the men did this; the women were too busy. The women do all kinds\\nof work on the continent. They dig, they hoe, they reap, they sow, they\\nbear monstrous burdens on their backs, they shove similar ones long\\ndistances on wheelbarrows, they drag the cart when there is no dog or\\nlean cow to drag it--and when there is, they assist the dog or cow. Age\\nis no matter--the older the woman the stronger she is, apparently.\\nOn the farm a woman\\'s duties are not defined--she does a little of\\neverything; but in the towns it is different, there she only does\\ncertain things, the men do the rest. For instance, a hotel chambermaid\\nhas nothing to do but make beds and fires in fifty or sixty rooms, bring\\ntowels and candles, and fetch several tons of water up several flights\\nof stairs, a hundred pounds at a time, in prodigious metal pitchers. She\\ndoes not have to work more than eighteen or twenty hours a day, and\\nshe can always get down on her knees and scrub the floors of halls and\\nclosets when she is tired and needs a rest.\\n\\nAs the morning advanced and the weather grew hot, we took off our\\noutside clothing and sat in a row along the edge of the raft and enjoyed\\nthe scenery, with our sun-umbrellas over our heads and our legs dangling\\nin the water.\\n\\nEvery now and then we plunged in and had a swim. Every projecting grassy\\ncape had its joyous group of naked children, the boys to themselves and\\nthe girls to themselves, the latter usually in care of some motherly\\ndame who sat in the shade of a tree with her knitting. The little boys\\nswam out to us, sometimes, but the little maids stood knee-deep in the\\nwater and stopped their splashing and frolicking to inspect the raft\\nwith their innocent eyes as it drifted by. Once we turned a corner\\nsuddenly and surprised a slender girl of twelve years or upward, just\\nstepping into the water. She had not time to run, but she did what\\nanswered just as well; she promptly drew a lithe young willow bough\\nathwart her white body with one hand, and then contemplated us with a\\nsimple and untroubled interest. Thus she stood while we glided by. She\\nwas a pretty creature, and she and her willow bough made a very\\npretty picture, and one which could not offend the modesty of the most\\nfastidious spectator. Her white skin had a low bank of fresh green\\nwillows for background and effective contrast--for she stood against\\nthem--and above and out of them projected the eager faces and white\\nshoulders of two smaller girls.\\n\\nToward noon we heard the inspiriting cry,--\\n\\n\"Sail ho!\"\\n\\n\"Where away?\" shouted the captain.\\n\\n\"Three points off the weather bow!\"\\n\\nWe ran forward to see the vessel. It proved to be a steamboat--for they\\nhad begun to run a steamer up the Neckar, for the first time in May.\\nShe was a tug, and one of a very peculiar build and aspect. I had often\\nwatched her from the hotel, and wondered how she propelled herself, for\\napparently she had no propeller or paddles. She came churning along,\\nnow, making a deal of noise of one kind or another, and aggravating it\\nevery now and then by blowing a hoarse whistle. She had nine keel-boats\\nhitched on behind and following after her in a long, slender rank. We\\nmet her in a narrow place, between dikes, and there was hardly room for\\nus both in the cramped passage. As she went grinding and groaning by, we\\nperceived the secret of her moving impulse. She did not drive herself up\\nthe river with paddles or propeller, she pulled herself by hauling on\\na great chain. This chain is laid in the bed of the river and is only\\nfastened at the two ends. It is seventy miles long. It comes in over the\\nboat\\'s bow, passes around a drum, and is payed out astern. She pulls\\non that chain, and so drags herself up the river or down it. She has\\nneither bow or stern, strictly speaking, for she has a long-bladed\\nrudder on each end and she never turns around. She uses both rudders\\nall the time, and they are powerful enough to enable her to turn to\\nthe right or the left and steer around curves, in spite of the strong\\nresistance of the chain. I would not have believed that that impossible\\nthing could be done; but I saw it done, and therefore I know that there\\nis one impossible thing which _can_ be done. What miracle will man\\nattempt next?\\n\\nWe met many big keel-boats on their way up, using sails, mule power, and\\nprofanity--a tedious and laborious business. A wire rope led from the\\nforetopmast to the file of mules on the tow-path a hundred yards ahead,\\nand by dint of much banging and swearing and urging, the detachment of\\ndrivers managed to get a speed of two or three miles an hour out of the\\nmules against the stiff current. The Neckar has always been used as a\\ncanal, and thus has given employment to a great many men and animals;\\nbut now that this steamboat is able, with a small crew and a bushel or\\nso of coal, to take nine keel-boats farther up the river in one hour\\nthan thirty men and thirty mules can do it in two, it is believed\\nthat the old-fashioned towing industry is on its death-bed. A second\\nsteamboat began work in the Neckar three months after the first one was\\nput in service. [Figure 4]\\n\\nAt noon we stepped ashore and bought some bottled beer and got some\\nchickens cooked, while the raft waited; then we immediately put to sea\\nagain, and had our dinner while the beer was cold and the chickens hot.\\nThere is no pleasanter place for such a meal than a raft that is\\ngliding down the winding Neckar past green meadows and wooded hills, and\\nslumbering villages, and craggy heights graced with crumbling towers and\\nbattlements.\\n\\nIn one place we saw a nicely dressed German gentleman without any\\nspectacles. Before I could come to anchor he had got underway. It was a\\ngreat pity. I so wanted to make a sketch of him. The captain comforted\\nme for my loss, however, by saying that the man was without any doubt a\\nfraud who had spectacles, but kept them in his pocket in order to make\\nhimself conspicuous.\\n\\nBelow Hassmersheim we passed Hornberg, Goetz von Berlichingen\\'s old\\ncastle. It stands on a bold elevation two hundred feet above the surface\\nof the river; it has high vine-clad walls enclosing trees, and a peaked\\ntower about seventy-five feet high. The steep hillside, from the castle\\nclear down to the water\\'s edge, is terraced, and clothed thick with\\ngrape vines. This is like farming a mansard roof. All the steeps along\\nthat part of the river which furnish the proper exposure, are given\\nup to the grape. That region is a great producer of Rhine wines. The\\nGermans are exceedingly fond of Rhine wines; they are put up in tall,\\nslender bottles, and are considered a pleasant beverage. One tells them\\nfrom vinegar by the label.\\n\\nThe Hornberg hill is to be tunneled, and the new railway will pass under\\nthe castle.\\n\\nTHE CAVE OF THE SPECTER\\n\\nTwo miles below Hornberg castle is a cave in a low cliff, which the\\ncaptain of the raft said had once been occupied by a beautiful heiress\\nof Hornberg--the Lady Gertrude--in the old times. It was seven hundred\\nyears ago. She had a number of rich and noble lovers and one poor and\\nobscure one, Sir Wendel Lobenfeld. With the native chuckleheadedness of\\nthe heroine of romance, she preferred the poor and obscure lover.\\n\\nWith the native sound judgment of the father of a heroine of romance,\\nthe von Berlichingen of that day shut his daughter up in his donjon\\nkeep, or his oubliette, or his culverin, or some such place, and\\nresolved that she should stay there until she selected a husband from\\namong her rich and noble lovers. The latter visited her and persecuted\\nher with their supplications, but without effect, for her heart was\\ntrue to her poor despised Crusader, who was fighting in the Holy Land.\\nFinally, she resolved that she would endure the attentions of the rich\\nlovers no longer; so one stormy night she escaped and went down\\nthe river and hid herself in the cave on the other side. Her father\\nransacked the country for her, but found not a trace of her. As the\\ndays went by, and still no tidings of her came, his conscience began to\\ntorture him, and he caused proclamation to be made that if she were yet\\nliving and would return, he would oppose her no longer, she might marry\\nwhom she would. The months dragged on, all hope forsook the old man, he\\nceased from his customary pursuits and pleasures, he devoted himself to\\npious works, and longed for the deliverance of death.\\n\\nNow just at midnight, every night, the lost heiress stood in the mouth\\nof her cave, arrayed in white robes, and sang a little love ballad which\\nher Crusader had made for her. She judged that if he came home alive the\\nsuperstitious peasants would tell him about the ghost that sang in the\\ncave, and that as soon as they described the ballad he would know that\\nnone but he and she knew that song, therefore he would suspect that she\\nwas alive, and would come and find her. As time went on, the people of\\nthe region became sorely distressed about the Specter of the Haunted\\nCave. It was said that ill luck of one kind or another always overtook\\nany one who had the misfortune to hear that song. Eventually, every\\ncalamity that happened thereabouts was laid at the door of that music.\\nConsequently, no boatmen would consent to pass the cave at night; the\\npeasants shunned the place, even in the daytime.\\n\\nBut the faithful girl sang on, night after night, month after month, and\\npatiently waited; her reward must come at last. Five years dragged by,\\nand still, every night at midnight, the plaintive tones floated out over\\nthe silent land, while the distant boatmen and peasants thrust their\\nfingers into their ears and shuddered out a prayer.\\n\\nAnd now came the Crusader home, bronzed and battle-scarred, but bringing\\na great and splendid fame to lay at the feet of his bride. The old lord\\nof Hornberg received him as his son, and wanted him to stay by him\\nand be the comfort and blessing of his age; but the tale of that young\\ngirl\\'s devotion to him and its pathetic consequences made a changed\\nman of the knight. He could not enjoy his well-earned rest. He said his\\nheart was broken, he would give the remnant of his life to high deeds in\\nthe cause of humanity, and so find a worthy death and a blessed reunion\\nwith the brave true heart whose love had more honored him than all his\\nvictories in war.\\n\\nWhen the people heard this resolve of his, they came and told him there\\nwas a pitiless dragon in human disguise in the Haunted Cave, a dread\\ncreature which no knight had yet been bold enough to face, and begged\\nhim to rid the land of its desolating presence. He said he would do it.\\nThey told him about the song, and when he asked what song it was, they\\nsaid the memory of it was gone, for nobody had been hardy enough to\\nlisten to it for the past four years and more.\\n\\nToward midnight the Crusader came floating down the river in a boat,\\nwith his trusty cross-bow in his hands. He drifted silently through the\\ndim reflections of the crags and trees, with his intent eyes fixed upon\\nthe low cliff which he was approaching. As he drew nearer, he discerned\\nthe black mouth of the cave. Now--is that a white figure? Yes. The\\nplaintive song begins to well forth and float away over meadow and\\nriver--the cross-bow is slowly raised to position, a steady aim is\\ntaken, the bolt flies straight to the mark--the figure sinks down, still\\nsinging, the knight takes the wool out of his ears, and recognizes the\\nold ballad--too late! Ah, if he had only not put the wool in his ears!\\n\\nThe Crusader went away to the wars again, and presently fell in battle,\\nfighting for the Cross. Tradition says that during several centuries the\\nspirit of the unfortunate girl sang nightly from the cave at midnight,\\nbut the music carried no curse with it; and although many listened for\\nthe mysterious sounds, few were favored, since only those could hear\\nthem who had never failed in a trust. It is believed that the singing\\nstill continues, but it is known that nobody has heard it during the\\npresent century.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVI\\n\\nAn Ancient Legend of the Rhine [The Lorelei]\\n\\nThe last legend reminds one of the \"Lorelei\"--a legend of the Rhine.\\nThere is a song called \"The Lorelei.\"\\n\\nGermany is rich in folk-songs, and the words and airs of several of them\\nare peculiarly beautiful--but \"The Lorelei\" is the people\\'s favorite. I\\ncould not endure it at first, but by and by it began to take hold of me,\\nand now there is no tune which I like so well.\\n\\nIt is not possible that it is much known in America, else I should have\\nheard it there. The fact that I never heard it there, is evidence that\\nthere are others in my country who have fared likewise; therefore, for\\nthe sake of these, I mean to print the words and music in this chapter.\\nAnd I will refresh the reader\\'s memory by printing the legend of the\\nLorelei, too. I have it by me in the _Legends of the Rhine_, done into\\nEnglish by the wildly gifted Garnham, Bachelor of Arts. I print the\\nlegend partly to refresh my own memory, too, for I have never read it\\nbefore.\\n\\nTHE LEGEND\\n\\nLore (two syllables) was a water nymph who used to sit on a high rock\\ncalled the Ley or Lei (pronounced like our word _lie_) in the Rhine, and\\nlure boatmen to destruction in a furious rapid which marred the channel\\nat that spot. She so bewitched them with her plaintive songs and her\\nwonderful beauty that they forgot everything else to gaze up at her, and\\nso they presently drifted among the broken reefs and were lost.\\n\\nIn those old, old times, the Count Bruno lived in a great castle near\\nthere with his son, the Count Hermann, a youth of twenty. Hermann had\\nheard a great deal about the beautiful Lore, and had finally fallen very\\ndeeply in love with her without having seen her. So he used to wander to\\nthe neighborhood of the Lei, evenings, with his Zither and \"Express his\\nLonging in low Singing,\" as Garnham says. On one of these occasions,\\n\"suddenly there hovered around the top of the rock a brightness of\\nunequaled clearness and color, which, in increasingly smaller circles\\nthickened, was the enchanting figure of the beautiful Lore.\\n\\n\"An unintentional cry of Joy escaped the Youth, he let his Zither fall,\\nand with extended arms he called out the name of the enigmatical Being,\\nwho seemed to stoop lovingly to him and beckon to him in a friendly\\nmanner; indeed, if his ear did not deceive him, she called his name with\\nunutterable sweet Whispers, proper to love. Beside himself with delight\\nthe youth lost his Senses and sank senseless to the earth.\"\\n\\nAfter that he was a changed person. He went dreaming about, thinking\\nonly of his fairy and caring for naught else in the world. \"The old\\ncount saw with affliction this changement in his son,\" whose cause he\\ncould not divine, and tried to divert his mind into cheerful channels,\\nbut to no purpose. Then the old count used authority. He commanded the\\nyouth to betake himself to the camp. Obedience was promised. Garnham\\nsays:\\n\\n\"It was on the evening before his departure, as he wished still once to\\nvisit the Lei and offer to the Nymph of the Rhine his Sighs, the\\ntones of his Zither, and his Songs. He went, in his boat, this time\\naccompanied by a faithful squire, down the stream. The moon shed her\\nsilvery light over the whole country; the steep bank mountains appeared\\nin the most fantastical shapes, and the high oaks on either side bowed\\ntheir Branches on Hermann\\'s passing. As soon as he approached the\\nLei, and was aware of the surf-waves, his attendant was seized with an\\ninexpressible Anxiety and he begged permission to land; but the Knight\\nswept the strings of his Guitar and sang:\\n\\n\"Once I saw thee in dark night, In supernatural Beauty bright; Of\\nLight-rays, was the Figure wove, To share its light, locked-hair strove.\\n\\n\"Thy Garment color wave-dove By thy hand the sign of love, Thy eyes\\nsweet enchantment, Raying to me, oh! enchantment.\\n\\n\"O, wert thou but my sweetheart, How willingly thy love to part! With\\ndelight I should be bound To thy rocky house in deep ground.\"\\n\\nThat Hermann should have gone to that place at all, was not wise; that\\nhe should have gone with such a song as that in his mouth was a most\\nserious mistake. The Lorelei did not \"call his name in unutterable\\nsweet Whispers\" this time. No, that song naturally worked an instant\\nand thorough \"changement\" in her; and not only that, but it stirred the\\nbowels of the whole afflicted region around about there--for--\\n\\n\"Scarcely had these tones sounded, everywhere there began tumult and\\nsound, as if voices above and below the water. On the Lei rose flames,\\nthe Fairy stood above, at that time, and beckoned with her right hand\\nclearly and urgently to the infatuated Knight, while with a staff in\\nher left hand she called the waves to her service. They began to mount\\nheavenward; the boat was upset, mocking every exertion; the waves rose\\nto the gunwale, and splitting on the hard stones, the Boat broke into\\nPieces. The youth sank into the depths, but the squire was thrown on\\nshore by a powerful wave.\"\\n\\nThe bitterest things have been said about the Lorelei during many\\ncenturies, but surely her conduct upon this occasion entitles her to our\\nrespect. One feels drawn tenderly toward her and is moved to forget her\\nmany crimes and remember only the good deed that crowned and closed her\\ncareer.\\n\\n\"The Fairy was never more seen; but her enchanting tones have often been\\nheard. In the beautiful, refreshing, still nights of spring, when the\\nmoon pours her silver light over the Country, the listening shipper\\nhears from the rushing of the waves, the echoing Clang of a wonderfully\\ncharming voice, which sings a song from the crystal castle, and with\\nsorrow and fear he thinks on the young Count Hermann, seduced by the\\nNymph.\"\\n\\nHere is the music, and the German words by Heinrich Heine. This song has\\nbeen a favorite in Germany for forty years, and will remain a favorite\\nalways, maybe. [Figure 5]\\n\\nI have a prejudice against people who print things in a foreign language\\nand add no translation. When I am the reader, and the author considers\\nme able to do the translating myself, he pays me quite a nice\\ncompliment--but if he would do the translating for me I would try to get\\nalong without the compliment.\\n\\nIf I were at home, no doubt I could get a translation of this poem, but\\nI am abroad and can\\'t; therefore I will make a translation myself. It\\nmay not be a good one, for poetry is out of my line, but it will serve\\nmy purpose--which is, to give the unGerman young girl a jingle of words\\nto hang the tune on until she can get hold of a good version, made by\\nsome one who is a poet and knows how to convey a poetical thought from\\none language to another.\\n\\nTHE LORELEI\\n\\nI cannot divine what it meaneth, This haunting nameless pain: A tale of\\nthe bygone ages Keeps brooding through my brain:\\n\\nThe faint air cools in the glooming, And peaceful flows the Rhine, The\\nthirsty summits are drinking The sunset\\'s flooding wine;\\n\\nThe loveliest maiden is sitting High-throned in yon blue air, Her golden\\njewels are shining, She combs her golden hair;\\n\\nShe combs with a comb that is golden, And sings a weird refrain That\\nsteeps in a deadly enchantment The list\\'ner\\'s ravished brain:\\n\\nThe doomed in his drifting shallop, Is tranced with the sad sweet tone,\\nHe sees not the yawning breakers, He sees but the maid alone:\\n\\nThe pitiless billows engulf him!--So perish sailor and bark; And this,\\nwith her baleful singing, Is the Lorelei\\'s gruesome work.\\n\\nI have a translation by Garnham, Bachelor of Arts, in the _Legends\\nof the Rhine_, but it would not answer the purpose I mentioned above,\\nbecause the measure is too nobly irregular; it don\\'t fit the tune snugly\\nenough; in places it hangs over at the ends too far, and in other\\nplaces one runs out of words before he gets to the end of a bar. Still,\\nGarnham\\'s translation has high merits, and I am not dreaming of leaving\\nit out of my book. I believe this poet is wholly unknown in America\\nand England; I take peculiar pleasure in bringing him forward because I\\nconsider that I discovered him:\\n\\nTHE LORELEI\\n\\nTranslated by L. W. Garnham, B.A. I do not know what it signifies. That\\nI am so sorrowful? A fable of old Times so terrifies, Leaves my heart so\\nthoughtful.\\n\\nThe air is cool and it darkens, And calmly flows the Rhine; The summit\\nof the mountain hearkens In evening sunshine line.\\n\\nThe most beautiful Maiden entrances Above wonderfully there, Her\\nbeautiful golden attire glances, She combs her golden hair.\\n\\nWith golden comb so lustrous, And thereby a song sings, It has a tone so\\nwondrous, That powerful melody rings.\\n\\nThe shipper in the little ship It effects with woe sad might; He does\\nnot see the rocky slip, He only regards dreaded height.\\n\\nI believe the turbulent waves Swallow the last shipper and boat; She\\nwith her singing craves All to visit hermagic moat.\\n\\nNo translation could be closer. He has got in all the facts; and in\\ntheir regular order, too. There is not a statistic wanting. It is as\\nsuccinct as an invoice. That is what a translation ought to be; it\\nshould exactly reflect the thought of the original. You can\\'t _sing_\\n\"Above wonderfully there,\" because it simply won\\'t go to the tune,\\nwithout damaging the singer; but it is a most clingingly exact\\ntranslation of _Dort Oben Wunderbar_--fits it like a blister. Mr.\\nGarnham\\'s reproduction has other merits--a hundred of them--but it is\\nnot necessary to point them out. They will be detected.\\n\\nNo one with a specialty can hope to have a monopoly of it. Even Garnham\\nhas a rival. Mr. X had a small pamphlet with him which he had bought\\nwhile on a visit to Munich. It was entitled _A Catalogue of Pictures in\\nthe Old Pinacotek_, and was written in a peculiar kind of English. Here\\nare a few extracts:\\n\\n\"It is not permitted to make use of the work in question to a\\npublication of the same contents as well as to the pirated edition of\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"An evening landscape.

St. John in Patterson\\'s Island.\"\\n\\nBut meanwhile the raft is moving on.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVII\\n\\n[Why Germans Wear Spectacles]\\n\\nA mile or two above Eberbach we saw a peculiar ruin projecting above the\\nfoliage which clothed the peak of a high and very steep hill. This ruin\\nconsisted of merely a couple of crumbling masses of masonry which bore\\na rude resemblance to human faces; they leaned forward and touched\\nforeheads, and had the look of being absorbed in conversation. This\\nruin had nothing very imposing or picturesque about it, and there was no\\ngreat deal of it, yet it was called the \"Spectacular Ruin.\"\\n\\nLEGEND OF THE \"SPECTACULAR RUIN\"\\n\\nThe captain of the raft, who was as full of history as he could stick,\\nsaid that in the Middle Ages a most prodigious fire-breathing dragon\\nused to live in that region, and made more trouble than a tax-collector.\\nHe was as long as a railway-train, and had the customary impenetrable\\ngreen scales all over him. His breath bred pestilence and conflagration,\\nand his appetite bred famine. He ate men and cattle impartially, and\\nwas exceedingly unpopular. The German emperor of that day made the usual\\noffer: he would grant to the destroyer of the dragon, any one solitary\\nthing he might ask for; for he had a surplusage of daughters, and it was\\ncustomary for dragon-killers to take a daughter for pay.\\n\\nSo the most renowned knights came from the four corners of the earth and\\nretired down the dragon\\'s throat one after the other. A panic arose and\\nspread. Heroes grew cautious. The procession ceased. The dragon became\\nmore destructive than ever. The people lost all hope of succor, and fled\\nto the mountains for refuge.\\n\\nAt last Sir Wissenschaft, a poor and obscure knight, out of a far\\ncountry, arrived to do battle with the monster. A pitiable object he\\nwas, with his armor hanging in rags about him, and his strange-shaped\\nknapsack strapped upon his back. Everybody turned up their noses at him,\\nand some openly jeered him. But he was calm. He simply inquired if\\nthe emperor\\'s offer was still in force. The emperor said it was--but\\ncharitably advised him to go and hunt hares and not endanger so precious\\na life as his in an attempt which had brought death to so many of the\\nworld\\'s most illustrious heroes.\\n\\nBut this tramp only asked--\"Were any of these heroes men of science?\"\\nThis raised a laugh, of course, for science was despised in those days.\\nBut the tramp was not in the least ruffled. He said he might be a little\\nin advance of his age, but no matter--science would come to be honored,\\nsome time or other. He said he would march against the dragon in the\\nmorning. Out of compassion, then, a decent spear was offered him, but\\nhe declined, and said, \"spears were useless to men of science.\" They\\nallowed him to sup in the servants\\' hall, and gave him a bed in the\\nstables.\\n\\nWhen he started forth in the morning, thousands were gathered to see.\\nThe emperor said:\\n\\n\"Do not be rash, take a spear, and leave off your knapsack.\"\\n\\nBut the tramp said:\\n\\n\"It is not a knapsack,\" and moved straight on.\\n\\nThe dragon was waiting and ready. He was breathing forth vast volumes\\nof sulphurous smoke and lurid blasts of flame. The ragged knight\\nstole warily to a good position, then he unslung his cylindrical\\nknapsack--which was simply the common fire-extinguisher known to modern\\ntimes--and the first chance he got he turned on his hose and shot the\\ndragon square in the center of his cavernous mouth. Out went the fires\\nin an instant, and the dragon curled up and died.\\n\\nThis man had brought brains to his aid. He had reared dragons from the\\negg, in his laboratory, he had watched over them like a mother, and\\npatiently studied them and experimented upon them while they grew. Thus\\nhe had found out that fire was the life principle of a dragon; put out\\nthe dragon\\'s fires and it could make steam no longer, and must die.\\nHe could not put out a fire with a spear, therefore he invented the\\nextinguisher. The dragon being dead, the emperor fell on the hero\\'s neck\\nand said:\\n\\n\"Deliverer, name your request,\" at the same time beckoning out behind\\nwith his heel for a detachment of his daughters to form and advance. But\\nthe tramp gave them no observance. He simply said:\\n\\n\"My request is, that upon me be conferred the monopoly of the\\nmanufacture and sale of spectacles in Germany.\"\\n\\nThe emperor sprang aside and exclaimed:\\n\\n\"This transcends all the impudence I ever heard! A modest demand, by my\\nhalidome! Why didn\\'t you ask for the imperial revenues at once, and be\\ndone with it?\"\\n\\nBut the monarch had given his word, and he kept it. To everybody\\'s\\nsurprise, the unselfish monopolist immediately reduced the price of\\nspectacles to such a degree that a great and crushing burden was removed\\nfrom the nation. The emperor, to commemorate this generous act, and to\\ntestify his appreciation of it, issued a decree commanding everybody to\\nbuy this benefactor\\'s spectacles and wear them, whether they needed them\\nor not.\\n\\nSo originated the wide-spread custom of wearing spectacles in Germany;\\nand as a custom once established in these old lands is imperishable,\\nthis one remains universal in the empire to this day. Such is the legend\\nof the monopolist\\'s once stately and sumptuous castle, now called the\\n\"Spectacular Ruin.\"\\n\\nOn the right bank, two or three miles below the Spectacular Ruin, we\\npassed by a noble pile of castellated buildings overlooking the water\\nfrom the crest of a lofty elevation. A stretch of two hundred yards of\\nthe high front wall was heavily draped with ivy, and out of the mass\\nof buildings within rose three picturesque old towers. The place was in\\nfine order, and was inhabited by a family of princely rank. This castle\\nhad its legend, too, but I should not feel justified in repeating it\\nbecause I doubted the truth of some of its minor details.\\n\\nAlong in this region a multitude of Italian laborers were blasting away\\nthe frontage of the hills to make room for the new railway. They were\\nfifty or a hundred feet above the river. As we turned a sharp corner\\nthey began to wave signals and shout warnings to us to look out for the\\nexplosions. It was all very well to warn us, but what could _we_ do?\\nYou can\\'t back a raft upstream, you can\\'t hurry it downstream, you can\\'t\\nscatter out to one side when you haven\\'t any room to speak of, you won\\'t\\ntake to the perpendicular cliffs on the other shore when they appear to\\nbe blasting there, too. Your resources are limited, you see. There is\\nsimply nothing for it but to watch and pray.\\n\\nFor some hours we had been making three and a half or four miles an hour\\nand we were still making that. We had been dancing right along until\\nthose men began to shout; then for the next ten minutes it seemed to me\\nthat I had never seen a raft go so slowly. When the first blast went\\noff we raised our sun-umbrellas and waited for the result. No harm\\ndone; none of the stones fell in the water. Another blast followed, and\\nanother and another. Some of the rubbish fell in the water just astern\\nof us.\\n\\nWe ran that whole battery of nine blasts in a row, and it was certainly\\none of the most exciting and uncomfortable weeks I ever spent, either\\naship or ashore. Of course we frequently manned the poles and shoved\\nearnestly for a second or so, but every time one of those spurts of dust\\nand debris shot aloft every man dropped his pole and looked up to get\\nthe bearings of his share of it. It was very busy times along there for\\na while. It appeared certain that we must perish, but even that was\\nnot the bitterest thought; no, the abjectly unheroic nature of the\\ndeath--that was the sting--that and the bizarre wording of the resulting\\nobituary: \"_Shot with a rock, on a raft_.\" There would be no poetry\\nwritten about it. None _could_ be written about it. Example:\\n\\n_Not_ by war\\'s shock, or war\\'s shaft,--_shot_, with a rock, on a raft.\\n\\nNo poet who valued his reputation would touch such a theme as that. I\\nshould be distinguished as the only \"distinguished dead\" who went down\\nto the grave unsonneted, in 1878.\\n\\nBut we escaped, and I have never regretted it. The last blast was a\\npeculiarly strong one, and after the small rubbish was done raining\\naround us and we were just going to shake hands over our deliverance, a\\nlater and larger stone came down amongst our little group of pedestrians\\nand wrecked an umbrella. It did no other harm, but we took to the water\\njust the same.\\n\\nIt seems that the heavy work in the quarries and the new railway\\ngradings is done mainly by Italians. That was a revelation. We have\\nthe notion in our country that Italians never do heavy work at all, but\\nconfine themselves to the lighter arts, like organ-grinding, operatic\\nsinging, and assassination. We have blundered, that is plain.\\n\\nAll along the river, near every village, we saw little station-houses\\nfor the future railway. They were finished and waiting for the rails and\\nbusiness. They were as trim and snug and pretty as they could be. They\\nwere always of brick or stone; they were of graceful shape, they had\\nvines and flowers about them already, and around them the grass was\\nbright and green, and showed that it was carefully looked after. They\\nwere a decoration to the beautiful landscape, not an offense. Wherever\\none saw a pile of gravel or a pile of broken stone, it was always heaped\\nas trimly and exactly as a new grave or a stack of cannon-balls; nothing\\nabout those stations or along the railroad or the wagon-road was\\nallowed to look shabby or be unornamental. The keeping a country in such\\nbeautiful order as Germany exhibits, has a wise practical side to\\nit, too, for it keeps thousands of people in work and bread who would\\notherwise be idle and mischievous.\\n\\nAs the night shut down, the captain wanted to tie up, but I thought\\nmaybe we might make Hirschhorn, so we went on. Presently the sky became\\novercast, and the captain came aft looking uneasy. He cast his eye\\naloft, then shook his head, and said it was coming on to blow. My party\\nwanted to land at once--therefore I wanted to go on. The captain said we\\nought to shorten sail anyway, out of common prudence. Consequently, the\\nlarboard watch was ordered to lay in his pole. It grew quite dark, now,\\nand the wind began to rise. It wailed through the swaying branches of\\nthe trees, and swept our decks in fitful gusts. Things were taking on an\\nugly look. The captain shouted to the steersman on the forward log:\\n\\n\"How\\'s she landing?\"\\n\\nThe answer came faint and hoarse from far forward:\\n\\n\"Nor\\'-east-and-by-nor\\'--east-by-east, half-east, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Let her go off a point!\"\\n\\n\"Aye-aye, sir!\"\\n\\n\"What water have you got?\"\\n\\n\"Shoal, sir. Two foot large, on the stabboard, two and a half scant on\\nthe labboard!\"\\n\\n\"Let her go off another point!\"\\n\\n\"Aye-aye, sir!\"\\n\\n\"Forward, men, all of you! Lively, now! Stand by to crowd her round the\\nweather corner!\"\\n\\n\"Aye-aye, sir!\"\\n\\nThen followed a wild running and trampling and hoarse shouting, but the\\nforms of the men were lost in the darkness and the sounds were distorted\\nand confused by the roaring of the wind through the shingle-bundles. By\\nthis time the sea was running inches high, and threatening every moment\\nto engulf the frail bark. Now came the mate, hurrying aft, and said,\\nclose to the captain\\'s ear, in a low, agitated voice:\\n\\n\"Prepare for the worst, sir--we have sprung a leak!\"\\n\\n\"Heavens! where?\"\\n\\n\"Right aft the second row of logs.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing but a miracle can save us! Don\\'t let the men know, or there\\nwill be a panic and mutiny! Lay her in shore and stand by to jump with\\nthe stern-line the moment she touches. Gentlemen, I must look to you to\\nsecond my endeavors in this hour of peril. You have hats--go forward and\\nbail for your lives!\"\\n\\nDown swept another mighty blast of wind, clothed in spray and thick\\ndarkness. At such a moment as this, came from away forward that most\\nappalling of all cries that are ever heard at sea:\\n\\n\"MAN OVERBOARD!\"\\n\\nThe captain shouted:\\n\\n\"Hard a-port! Never mind the man! Let him climb aboard or wade ashore!\"\\n\\nAnother cry came down the wind:\\n\\n\"Breakers ahead!\"\\n\\n\"Where away?\"\\n\\n\"Not a log\\'s length off her port fore-foot!\"\\n\\nWe had groped our slippery way forward, and were now bailing with the\\nfrenzy of despair, when we heard the mate\\'s terrified cry, from far aft:\\n\\n\"Stop that dashed bailing, or we shall be aground!\"\\n\\nBut this was immediately followed by the glad shout:\\n\\n\"Land aboard the starboard transom!\"\\n\\n\"Saved!\" cried the captain. \"Jump ashore and take a turn around a tree\\nand pass the bight aboard!\"\\n\\nThe next moment we were all on shore weeping and embracing for joy,\\nwhile the rain poured down in torrents. The captain said he had been a\\nmariner for forty years on the Neckar, and in that time had seen storms\\nto make a man\\'s cheek blanch and his pulses stop, but he had never,\\nnever seen a storm that even approached this one. How familiar that\\nsounded! For I have been at sea a good deal and have heard that remark\\nfrom captains with a frequency accordingly.\\n\\nWe framed in our minds the usual resolution of thanks and admiration\\nand gratitude, and took the first opportunity to vote it, and put it\\nin writing and present it to the captain, with the customary speech. We\\ntramped through the darkness and the drenching summer rain full three\\nmiles, and reached \"The Naturalist Tavern\" in the village of Hirschhorn\\njust an hour before midnight, almost exhausted from hardship, fatigue,\\nand terror. I can never forget that night.\\n\\nThe landlord was rich, and therefore could afford to be crusty and\\ndisobliging; he did not at all like being turned out of his warm bed to\\nopen his house for us. But no matter, his household got up and cooked\\na quick supper for us, and we brewed a hot punch for ourselves, to keep\\noff consumption. After supper and punch we had an hour\\'s soothing smoke\\nwhile we fought the naval battle over again and voted the resolutions;\\nthen we retired to exceedingly neat and pretty chambers upstairs that\\nhad clean, comfortable beds in them with heirloom pillowcases most\\nelaborately and tastefully embroidered by hand.\\n\\nSuch rooms and beds and embroidered linen are as frequent in German\\nvillage inns as they are rare in ours. Our villages are superior\\nto German villages in more merits, excellences, conveniences, and\\nprivileges than I can enumerate, but the hotels do not belong in the\\nlist.\\n\\n\"The Naturalist Tavern\" was not a meaningless name; for all the halls\\nand all the rooms were lined with large glass cases which were filled\\nwith all sorts of birds and animals, glass-eyed, ably stuffed, and set\\nup in the most natural eloquent and dramatic attitudes. The moment we\\nwere abed, the rain cleared away and the moon came out. I dozed off to\\nsleep while contemplating a great white stuffed owl which was looking\\nintently down on me from a high perch with the air of a person who\\nthought he had met me before, but could not make out for certain.\\n\\nBut young Z did not get off so easily. He said that as he was sinking\\ndeliciously to sleep, the moon lifted away the shadows and developed\\na huge cat, on a bracket, dead and stuffed, but crouching, with every\\nmuscle tense, for a spring, and with its glittering glass eyes aimed\\nstraight at him. It made Z uncomfortable. He tried closing his own eyes,\\nbut that did not answer, for a natural instinct kept making him open\\nthem again to see if the cat was still getting ready to launch at\\nhim--which she always was. He tried turning his back, but that was a\\nfailure; he knew the sinister eyes were on him still. So at last he had\\nto get up, after an hour or two of worry and experiment, and set the cat\\nout in the hall. So he won, that time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XVIII\\n\\n[The Kindly Courtesy of Germans]\\n\\nIn the morning we took breakfast in the garden, under the trees, in the\\ndelightful German summer fashion. The air was filled with the fragrance\\nof flowers and wild animals; the living portion of the menagerie of the\\n\"Naturalist Tavern\" was all about us. There were great cages populous\\nwith fluttering and chattering foreign birds, and other great cages and\\ngreater wire pens, populous with quadrupeds, both native and foreign.\\nThere were some free creatures, too, and quite sociable ones they were.\\nWhite rabbits went loping about the place, and occasionally came and\\nsniffed at our shoes and shins; a fawn, with a red ribbon on its neck,\\nwalked up and examined us fearlessly; rare breeds of chickens and doves\\nbegged for crumbs, and a poor old tailless raven hopped about with\\na humble, shamefaced mein which said, \"Please do not notice my\\nexposure--think how you would feel in my circumstances, and be\\ncharitable.\" If he was observed too much, he would retire behind\\nsomething and stay there until he judged the party\\'s interest had found\\nanother object. I never have seen another dumb creature that was\\nso morbidly sensitive. Bayard Taylor, who could interpret the dim\\nreasonings of animals, and understood their moral natures better than\\nmost men, would have found some way to make this poor old chap forget\\nhis troubles for a while, but we have not his kindly art, and so had to\\nleave the raven to his griefs.\\n\\nAfter breakfast we climbed the hill and visited the ancient castle of\\nHirschhorn, and the ruined church near it. There were some curious old\\nbas-reliefs leaning against the inner walls of the church--sculptured\\nlords of Hirschhorn in complete armor, and ladies of Hirschhorn in\\nthe picturesque court costumes of the Middle Ages. These things are\\nsuffering damage and passing to decay, for the last Hirschhorn has been\\ndead two hundred years, and there is nobody now who cares to preserve\\nthe family relics. In the chancel was a twisted stone column, and the\\ncaptain told us a legend about it, of course, for in the matter of\\nlegends he could not seem to restrain himself; but I do not repeat his\\ntale because there was nothing plausible about it except that the Hero\\nwrenched this column into its present screw-shape with his hands--just\\none single wrench. All the rest of the legend was doubtful.\\n\\nBut Hirschhorn is best seen from a distance, down the river. Then\\nthe clustered brown towers perched on the green hilltop, and the old\\nbattlemented stone wall, stretching up and over the grassy ridge and\\ndisappearing in the leafy sea beyond, make a picture whose grace and\\nbeauty entirely satisfy the eye.\\n\\nWe descended from the church by steep stone stairways which curved this\\nway and that down narrow alleys between the packed and dirty tenements\\nof the village. It was a quarter well stocked with deformed, leering,\\nunkempt and uncombed idiots, who held out hands or caps and begged\\npiteously. The people of the quarter were not all idiots, of course, but\\nall that begged seemed to be, and were said to be.\\n\\nI was thinking of going by skiff to the next town, Necharsteinach; so I\\nran to the riverside in advance of the party and asked a man there if\\nhe had a boat to hire. I suppose I must have spoken High German--Court\\nGerman--I intended it for that, anyway--so he did not understand me. I\\nturned and twisted my question around and about, trying to strike that\\nman\\'s average, but failed. He could not make out what I wanted. Now Mr.\\nX arrived, faced this same man, looked him in the eye, and emptied this\\nsentence on him, in the most glib and confident way: \"Can man boat get\\nhere?\"\\n\\nThe mariner promptly understood and promptly answered. I can comprehend\\nwhy he was able to understand that particular sentence, because by mere\\naccident all the words in it except \"get\" have the same sound and the\\nsame meaning in German that they have in English; but how he managed to\\nunderstand Mr. X\\'s next remark puzzled me. I will insert it, presently.\\nX turned away a moment, and I asked the mariner if he could not find\\na board, and so construct an additional seat. I spoke in the purest\\nGerman, but I might as well have spoken in the purest Choctaw for all\\nthe good it did. The man tried his best to understand me; he tried, and\\nkept on trying, harder and harder, until I saw it was really of no use,\\nand said:\\n\\n\"There, don\\'t strain yourself--it is of no consequence.\"\\n\\nThen X turned to him and crisply said:\\n\\n\"_Machen sie_ a flat board.\"\\n\\nI wish my epitaph may tell the truth about me if the man did not answer\\nup at once, and say he would go and borrow a board as soon as he had lit\\nthe pipe which he was filling.\\n\\nWe changed our mind about taking a boat, so we did not have to go. I\\nhave given Mr. X\\'s two remarks just as he made them. Four of the five\\nwords in the first one were English, and that they were also German was\\nonly accidental, not intentional; three out of the five words in the\\nsecond remark were English, and English only, and the two German ones\\ndid not mean anything in particular, in such a connection.\\n\\nX always spoke English to Germans, but his plan was to turn the sentence\\nwrong end first and upside down, according to German construction, and\\nsprinkle in a German word without any essential meaning to it, here and\\nthere, by way of flavor. Yet he always made himself understood. He could\\nmake those dialect-speaking raftsmen understand him, sometimes, when\\neven young Z had failed with them; and young Z was a pretty good German\\nscholar. For one thing, X always spoke with such confidence--perhaps\\nthat helped. And possibly the raftsmen\\'s dialect was what is called\\n_Platt-Deutsch_, and so they found his English more familiar to their\\nears than another man\\'s German. Quite indifferent students of German\\ncan read Fritz Reuter\\'s charming platt-Deutch tales with some little\\nfacility because many of the words are English. I suppose this is the\\ntongue which our Saxon ancestors carried to England with them. By and by\\nI will inquire of some other philologist.\\n\\nHowever, in the mean time it had transpired that the men employed to\\ncalk the raft had found that the leak was not a leak at all, but only\\na crack between the logs--a crack that belonged there, and was not\\ndangerous, but had been magnified into a leak by the disordered\\nimagination of the mate. Therefore we went aboard again with a good\\ndegree of confidence, and presently got to sea without accident. As we\\nswam smoothly along between the enchanting shores, we fell to swapping\\nnotes about manners and customs in Germany and elsewhere.\\n\\nAs I write, now, many months later, I perceive that each of us, by\\nobserving and noting and inquiring, diligently and day by day, had\\nmanaged to lay in a most varied and opulent stock of misinformation. But\\nthis is not surprising; it is very difficult to get accurate details in\\nany country. For example, I had the idea once, in Heidelberg, to find\\nout all about those five student-corps. I started with the White Cap\\ncorps. I began to inquire of this and that and the other citizen, and\\nhere is what I found out:\\n\\n1. It is called the Prussian Corps, because none but Prussians are\\nadmitted to it.\\n\\n2. It is called the Prussian Corps for no particular reason. It has\\nsimply pleased each corps to name itself after some German state.\\n\\n3. It is not named the Prussian Corps at all, but only the White Cap\\nCorps.\\n\\n4. Any student can belong to it who is a German by birth.\\n\\n5. Any student can belong to it who is European by birth.\\n\\n6. Any European-born student can belong to it, except he be a Frenchman.\\n\\n7. Any student can belong to it, no matter where he was born.\\n\\n8. No student can belong to it who is not of noble blood.\\n\\n9. No student can belong to it who cannot show three full generations of\\nnoble descent.\\n\\n10. Nobility is not a necessary qualification.\\n\\n11. No moneyless student can belong to it.\\n\\n12. Money qualification is nonsense--such a thing has never been thought\\nof.\\n\\nI got some of this information from students themselves--students who\\ndid not belong to the corps.\\n\\nI finally went to headquarters--to the White Caps--where I would\\nhave gone in the first place if I had been acquainted. But even at\\nheadquarters I found difficulties; I perceived that there were things\\nabout the White Cap Corps which one member knew and another one didn\\'t.\\nIt was natural; for very few members of any organization know _all_ that\\ncan be known about it. I doubt there is a man or a woman in Heidelberg\\nwho would not answer promptly and confidently three out of every five\\nquestions about the White Cap Corps which a stranger might ask; yet\\nit is a very safe bet that two of the three answers would be incorrect\\nevery time.\\n\\nThere is one German custom which is universal--the bowing courteously\\nto strangers when sitting down at table or rising up from it. This\\nbow startles a stranger out of his self-possession, the first time\\nit occurs, and he is likely to fall over a chair or something, in his\\nembarrassment, but it pleases him, nevertheless. One soon learns to\\nexpect this bow and be on the lookout and ready to return it; but to\\nlearn to lead off and make the initial bow one\\'s self is a difficult\\nmatter for a diffident man. One thinks, \"If I rise to go, and tender my\\nbow, and these ladies and gentlemen take it into their heads to ignore\\nthe custom of their nation, and not return it, how shall I feel, in case\\nI survive to feel anything.\" Therefore he is afraid to venture. He sits\\nout the dinner, and makes the strangers rise first and originate the\\nbowing. A table d\\'hte dinner is a tedious affair for a man who seldom\\ntouches anything after the three first courses; therefore I used to do\\nsome pretty dreary waiting because of my fears. It took me months to\\nassure myself that those fears were groundless, but I did assure myself\\nat last by experimenting diligently through my agent. I made Harris get\\nup and bow and leave; invariably his bow was returned, then I got up and\\nbowed myself and retired.\\n\\nThus my education proceeded easily and comfortably for me, but not for\\nHarris. Three courses of a table d\\'hte dinner were enough for me, but\\nHarris preferred thirteen.\\n\\nEven after I had acquired full confidence, and no longer needed the\\nagent\\'s help, I sometimes encountered difficulties. Once at Baden-Baden\\nI nearly lost a train because I could not be sure that three young\\nladies opposite me at table were Germans, since I had not heard them\\nspeak; they might be American, they might be English, it was not safe\\nto venture a bow; but just as I had got that far with my thought, one of\\nthem began a German remark, to my great relief and gratitude; and before\\nshe got out her third word, our bows had been delivered and graciously\\nreturned, and we were off.\\n\\nThere is a friendly something about the German character which is very\\nwinning. When Harris and I were making a pedestrian tour through the\\nBlack Forest, we stopped at a little country inn for dinner one day;\\ntwo young ladies and a young gentleman entered and sat down opposite us.\\nThey were pedestrians, too. Our knapsacks were strapped upon our backs,\\nbut they had a sturdy youth along to carry theirs for them. All parties\\nwere hungry, so there was no talking. By and by the usual bows were\\nexchanged, and we separated.\\n\\nAs we sat at a late breakfast in the hotel at Allerheiligen, next\\nmorning, these young people entered and took places near us without\\nobserving us; but presently they saw us and at once bowed and smiled;\\nnot ceremoniously, but with the gratified look of people who have found\\nacquaintances where they were expecting strangers. Then they spoke of\\nthe weather and the roads. We also spoke of the weather and the roads.\\nNext, they said they had had an enjoyable walk, notwithstanding the\\nweather. We said that that had been our case, too. Then they said they\\nhad walked thirty English miles the day before, and asked how many we\\nhad walked. I could not lie, so I told Harris to do it. Harris told\\nthem we had made thirty English miles, too. That was true; we had \"made\"\\nthem, though we had had a little assistance here and there.\\n\\nAfter breakfast they found us trying to blast some information out\\nof the dumb hotel clerk about routes, and observing that we were not\\nsucceeding pretty well, they went and got their maps and things, and\\npointed out and explained our course so clearly that even a New York\\ndetective could have followed it. And when we started they spoke out a\\nhearty good-by and wished us a pleasant journey. Perhaps they were more\\ngenerous with us than they might have been with native wayfarers because\\nwe were a forlorn lot and in a strange land; I don\\'t know; I only know\\nit was lovely to be treated so.\\n\\nVery well, I took an American young lady to one of the fine balls in\\nBaden-Baden, one night, and at the entrance-door upstairs we were halted\\nby an official--something about Miss Jones\\'s dress was not according to\\nrule; I don\\'t remember what it was, now; something was wanting--her back\\nhair, or a shawl, or a fan, or a shovel, or something. The official was\\never so polite, and ever so sorry, but the rule was strict, and he could\\nnot let us in. It was very embarrassing, for many eyes were on us. But\\nnow a richly dressed girl stepped out of the ballroom, inquired into the\\ntrouble, and said she could fix it in a moment. She took Miss Jones to\\nthe robing-room, and soon brought her back in regulation trim, and then\\nwe entered the ballroom with this benefactress unchallenged.\\n\\nBeing safe, now, I began to puzzle through my sincere but ungrammatical\\nthanks, when there was a sudden mutual recognition--the benefactress\\nand I had met at Allerheiligen. Two weeks had not altered her good face,\\nand plainly her heart was in the right place yet, but there was such\\na difference between these clothes and the clothes I had seen her in\\nbefore, when she was walking thirty miles a day in the Black Forest,\\nthat it was quite natural that I had failed to recognize her sooner. I\\nhad on _my_ other suit, too, but my German would betray me to a person\\nwho had heard it once, anyway. She brought her brother and sister, and\\nthey made our way smooth for that evening.\\n\\nWell--months afterward, I was driving through the streets of Munich in a\\ncab with a German lady, one day, when she said:\\n\\n\"There, that is Prince Ludwig and his wife, walking along there.\"\\n\\nEverybody was bowing to them--cabmen, little children, and everybody\\nelse--and they were returning all the bows and overlooking nobody, when\\na young lady met them and made a deep courtesy.\\n\\n\"That is probably one of the ladies of the court,\" said my German\\nfriend.\\n\\nI said:\\n\\n\"She is an honor to it, then. I know her. I don\\'t know her name, but I\\nknow _her_. I have known her at Allerheiligen and Baden-Baden. She ought\\nto be an Empress, but she may be only a Duchess; it is the way things go\\nin this way.\"\\n\\nIf one asks a German a civil question, he will be quite sure to get a\\ncivil answer. If you stop a German in the street and ask him to direct\\nyou to a certain place, he shows no sign of feeling offended. If the\\nplace be difficult to find, ten to one the man will drop his own matters\\nand go with you and show you.\\n\\nIn London, too, many a time, strangers have walked several blocks with\\nme to show me my way.\\n\\nThere is something very real about this sort of politeness. Quite often,\\nin Germany, shopkeepers who could not furnish me the article I wanted\\nhave sent one of their employees with me to show me a place where it\\ncould be had.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XIX\\n\\n[The Deadly Jest of Dilsberg]\\n\\nHowever, I wander from the raft. We made the port of Necharsteinach in\\ngood season, and went to the hotel and ordered a trout dinner, the same\\nto be ready against our return from a two-hour pedestrian excursion to\\nthe village and castle of Dilsberg, a mile distant, on the other side\\nof the river. I do not mean that we proposed to be two hours making two\\nmiles--no, we meant to employ most of the time in inspecting Dilsberg.\\n\\nFor Dilsberg is a quaint place. It is most quaintly and picturesquely\\nsituated, too. Imagine the beautiful river before you; then a few rods\\nof brilliant green sward on its opposite shore; then a sudden hill--no\\npreparatory gently rising slopes, but a sort of instantaneous hill--a\\nhill two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet high, as round as a\\nbowl, with the same taper upward that an inverted bowl has, and with\\nabout the same relation of height to diameter that distinguishes a\\nbowl of good honest depth--a hill which is thickly clothed with green\\nbushes--a comely, shapely hill, rising abruptly out of the dead level\\nof the surrounding green plains, visible from a great distance down the\\nbends of the river, and with just exactly room on the top of its head\\nfor its steepled and turreted and roof-clustered cap of architecture,\\nwhich same is tightly jammed and compacted within the perfectly round\\nhoop of the ancient village wall.\\n\\nThere is no house outside the wall on the whole hill, or any vestige of\\na former house; all the houses are inside the wall, but there isn\\'t room\\nfor another one. It is really a finished town, and has been finished a\\nvery long time. There is no space between the wall and the first circle\\nof buildings; no, the village wall is itself the rear wall of the first\\ncircle of buildings, and the roofs jut a little over the wall and\\nthus furnish it with eaves. The general level of the massed roofs is\\ngracefully broken and relieved by the dominating towers of the ruined\\ncastle and the tall spires of a couple of churches; so, from a distance\\nDilsberg has rather more the look of a king\\'s crown than a cap. That\\nlofty green eminence and its quaint coronet form quite a striking\\npicture, you may be sure, in the flush of the evening sun.\\n\\nWe crossed over in a boat and began the ascent by a narrow, steep path\\nwhich plunged us at once into the leafy deeps of the bushes. But they\\nwere not cool deeps by any means, for the sun\\'s rays were weltering hot\\nand there was little or no breeze to temper them. As we panted up the\\nsharp ascent, we met brown, bareheaded and barefooted boys and girls,\\noccasionally, and sometimes men; they came upon us without warning, they\\ngave us good day, flashed out of sight in the bushes, and were gone\\nas suddenly and mysteriously as they had come. They were bound for the\\nother side of the river to work. This path had been traveled by many\\ngenerations of these people. They have always gone down to the valley to\\nearn their bread, but they have always climbed their hill again to eat\\nit, and to sleep in their snug town.\\n\\nIt is said that the Dilsbergers do not emigrate much; they find that\\nliving up there above the world, in their peaceful nest, is pleasanter\\nthan living down in the troublous world. The seven hundred inhabitants\\nare all blood-kin to each other, too; they have always been blood-kin to\\neach other for fifteen hundred years; they are simply one large family,\\nand they like the home folks better than they like strangers, hence they\\npersistently stay at home. It has been said that for ages Dilsberg\\nhas been merely a thriving and diligent idiot-factory. I saw no idiots\\nthere, but the captain said, \"Because of late years the government has\\ntaken to lugging them off to asylums and otherwheres; and government\\nwants to cripple the factory, too, and is trying to get these\\nDilsbergers to marry out of the family, but they don\\'t like to.\"\\n\\nThe captain probably imagined all this, as modern science denies that\\nthe intermarrying of relatives deteriorates the stock.\\n\\nArrived within the wall, we found the usual village sights and life. We\\nmoved along a narrow, crooked lane which had been paved in the Middle\\nAges. A strapping, ruddy girl was beating flax or some such stuff in\\na little bit of a good-box of a barn, and she swung her flail with a\\nwill--if it was a flail; I was not farmer enough to know what she was\\nat; a frowsy, barelegged girl was herding half a dozen geese with\\na stick--driving them along the lane and keeping them out of the\\ndwellings; a cooper was at work in a shop which I know he did not make\\nso large a thing as a hogshead in, for there was not room. In the front\\nrooms of dwellings girls and women were cooking or spinning, and ducks\\nand chickens were waddling in and out, over the threshold, picking up\\nchance crumbs and holding pleasant converse; a very old and wrinkled\\nman sat asleep before his door, with his chin upon his breast and his\\nextinguished pipe in his lap; soiled children were playing in the dirt\\neverywhere along the lane, unmindful of the sun.\\n\\nExcept the sleeping old man, everybody was at work, but the place was\\nvery still and peaceful, nevertheless; so still that the distant\\ncackle of the successful hen smote upon the ear but little dulled\\nby intervening sounds. That commonest of village sights was lacking\\nhere--the public pump, with its great stone tank or trough of limpid\\nwater, and its group of gossiping pitcher-bearers; for there is no well\\nor fountain or spring on this tall hill; cisterns of rain-water are\\nused.\\n\\nOur alpenstocks and muslin tails compelled attention, and as we moved\\nthrough the village we gathered a considerable procession of little boys\\nand girls, and so went in some state to the castle. It proved to be an\\nextensive pile of crumbling walls, arches, and towers, massive, properly\\ngrouped for picturesque effect, weedy, grass-grown, and satisfactory.\\nThe children acted as guides; they walked us along the top of the\\nhighest walls, then took us up into a high tower and showed us a wide\\nand beautiful landscape, made up of wavy distances of woody hills, and\\na nearer prospect of undulating expanses of green lowlands, on the one\\nhand, and castle-graced crags and ridges on the other, with the shining\\ncurves of the Neckar flowing between. But the principal show, the chief\\npride of the children, was the ancient and empty well in the grass-grown\\ncourt of the castle. Its massive stone curb stands up three or four feet\\nabove-ground, and is whole and uninjured. The children said that in the\\nMiddle Ages this well was four hundred feet deep, and furnished all the\\nvillage with an abundant supply of water, in war and peace. They said\\nthat in the old day its bottom was below the level of the Neckar, hence\\nthe water-supply was inexhaustible.\\n\\nBut there were some who believed it had never been a well at all, and\\nwas never deeper than it is now--eighty feet; that at that depth a\\nsubterranean passage branched from it and descended gradually to a\\nremote place in the valley, where it opened into somebody\\'s cellar or\\nother hidden recess, and that the secret of this locality is now lost.\\nThose who hold this belief say that herein lies the explanation that\\nDilsberg, besieged by Tilly and many a soldier before him, was\\nnever taken: after the longest and closest sieges the besiegers were\\nastonished to perceive that the besieged were as fat and hearty as ever,\\nand were well furnished with munitions of war--therefore it must be\\nthat the Dilsbergers had been bringing these things in through the\\nsubterranean passage all the time.\\n\\nThe children said that there was in truth a subterranean outlet down\\nthere, and they would prove it. So they set a great truss of straw on\\nfire and threw it down the well, while we leaned on the curb and watched\\nthe glowing mass descend. It struck bottom and gradually burned out. No\\nsmoke came up. The children clapped their hands and said:\\n\\n\"You see! Nothing makes so much smoke as burning straw--now where did\\nthe smoke go to, if there is no subterranean outlet?\"\\n\\nSo it seemed quite evident that the subterranean outlet indeed existed.\\nBut the finest thing within the ruin\\'s limits was a noble linden, which\\nthe children said was four hundred years old, and no doubt it was. It\\nhad a mighty trunk and a mighty spread of limb and foliage. The limbs\\nnear the ground were nearly the thickness of a barrel.\\n\\nThat tree had witnessed the assaults of men in mail--how remote such a\\ntime seems, and how ungraspable is the fact that real men ever did fight\\nin real armor!--and it had seen the time when these broken arches and\\ncrumbling battlements were a trim and strong and stately fortress,\\nfluttering its gay banners in the sun, and peopled with vigorous\\nhumanity--how impossibly long ago that seems!--and here it stands yet,\\nand possibly may still be standing here, sunning itself and dreaming its\\nhistorical dreams, when today shall have been joined to the days called\\n\"ancient.\"\\n\\nWell, we sat down under the tree to smoke, and the captain delivered\\nhimself of his legend:\\n\\nTHE LEGEND OF DILSBERG CASTLE\\n\\nIt was to this effect. In the old times there was once a great company\\nassembled at the castle, and festivity ran high. Of course there was a\\nhaunted chamber in the castle, and one day the talk fell upon that. It\\nwas said that whoever slept in it would not wake again for fifty years.\\nNow when a young knight named Conrad von Geisberg heard this, he said\\nthat if the castle were his he would destroy that chamber, so that no\\nfoolish person might have the chance to bring so dreadful a misfortune\\nupon himself and afflict such as loved him with the memory of it.\\nStraightway, the company privately laid their heads together to contrive\\nsome way to get this superstitious young man to sleep in that chamber.\\n\\nAnd they succeeded--in this way. They persuaded his betrothed, a lovely\\nmischievous young creature, niece of the lord of the castle, to help\\nthem in their plot. She presently took him aside and had speech with\\nhim. She used all her persuasions, but could not shake him; he said his\\nbelief was firm, that if he should sleep there he would wake no more for\\nfifty years, and it made him shudder to think of it. Catharina began to\\nweep. This was a better argument; Conrad could not hold out against it.\\nHe yielded and said she should have her wish if she would only smile and\\nbe happy again. She flung her arms about his neck, and the kisses she\\ngave him showed that her thankfulness and her pleasure were very real.\\nThen she flew to tell the company her success, and the applause she\\nreceived made her glad and proud she had undertaken her mission, since\\nall alone she had accomplished what the multitude had failed in.\\n\\nAt midnight, that night, after the usual feasting, Conrad was taken to\\nthe haunted chamber and left there. He fell asleep, by and by.\\n\\nWhen he awoke again and looked about him, his heart stood still with\\nhorror! The whole aspect of the chamber was changed. The walls were\\nmoldy and hung with ancient cobwebs; the curtains and beddings were\\nrotten; the furniture was rickety and ready to fall to pieces. He sprang\\nout of bed, but his quaking knees sunk under him and he fell to the\\nfloor.\\n\\n\"This is the weakness of age,\" he said.\\n\\nHe rose and sought his clothing. It was clothing no longer. The colors\\nwere gone, the garments gave way in many places while he was putting\\nthem on. He fled, shuddering, into the corridor, and along it to\\nthe great hall. Here he was met by a middle-aged stranger of a kind\\ncountenance, who stopped and gazed at him with surprise. Conrad said:\\n\\n\"Good sir, will you send hither the lord Ulrich?\"\\n\\nThe stranger looked puzzled a moment, then said:\\n\\n\"The lord Ulrich?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--if you will be so good.\"\\n\\nThe stranger called--\"Wilhelm!\" A young serving-man came, and the\\nstranger said to him:\\n\\n\"Is there a lord Ulrich among the guests?\"\\n\\n\"I know none of the name, so please your honor.\"\\n\\nConrad said, hesitatingly:\\n\\n\"I did not mean a guest, but the lord of the castle, sir.\"\\n\\nThe stranger and the servant exchanged wondering glances. Then the\\nformer said:\\n\\n\"I am the lord of the castle.\"\\n\\n\"Since when, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Since the death of my father, the good lord Ulrich more than forty\\nyears ago.\"\\n\\nConrad sank upon a bench and covered his face with his hands while he\\nrocked his body to and fro and moaned. The stranger said in a low voice\\nto the servant:\\n\\n\"I fear me this poor old creature is mad. Call some one.\"\\n\\nIn a moment several people came, and grouped themselves about, talking\\nin whispers. Conrad looked up and scanned the faces about him wistfully.\\n\\nThen he shook his head and said, in a grieved voice:\\n\\n\"No, there is none among ye that I know. I am old and alone in the\\nworld. They are dead and gone these many years that cared for me. But\\nsure, some of these aged ones I see about me can tell me some little\\nword or two concerning them.\"\\n\\nSeveral bent and tottering men and women came nearer and answered his\\nquestions about each former friend as he mentioned the names. This one\\nthey said had been dead ten years, that one twenty, another thirty. Each\\nsucceeding blow struck heavier and heavier. At last the sufferer said:\\n\\n\"There is one more, but I have not the courage to--O my lost Catharina!\"\\n\\nOne of the old dames said:\\n\\n\"Ah, I knew her well, poor soul. A misfortune overtook her lover, and\\nshe died of sorrow nearly fifty years ago. She lieth under the linden\\ntree without the court.\"\\n\\nConrad bowed his head and said:\\n\\n\"Ah, why did I ever wake! And so she died of grief for me, poor child.\\nSo young, so sweet, so good! She never wittingly did a hurtful thing in\\nall the little summer of her life. Her loving debt shall be repaid--for\\nI will die of grief for her.\"\\n\\nHis head drooped upon his breast. In the moment there was a wild burst\\nof joyous laughter, a pair of round young arms were flung about Conrad\\'s\\nneck and a sweet voice cried:\\n\\n\"There, Conrad mine, thy kind words kill me--the farce shall go no\\nfurther! Look up, and laugh with us--\\'twas all a jest!\"\\n\\nAnd he did look up, and gazed, in a dazed wonderment--for the disguises\\nwere stripped away, and the aged men and women were bright and young and\\ngay again. Catharina\\'s happy tongue ran on:\\n\\n\"\\'Twas a marvelous jest, and bravely carried out. They gave you a heavy\\nsleeping-draught before you went to bed, and in the night they bore you\\nto a ruined chamber where all had fallen to decay, and placed these rags\\nof clothing by you. And when your sleep was spent and you came forth,\\ntwo strangers, well instructed in their parts, were here to meet you;\\nand all we, your friends, in our disguises, were close at hand, to see\\nand hear, you may be sure. Ah, \\'twas a gallant jest! Come, now, and make\\nthee ready for the pleasures of the day. How real was thy misery for the\\nmoment, thou poor lad! Look up and have thy laugh, now!\"\\n\\nHe looked up, searched the merry faces about him in a dreamy way, then\\nsighed and said:\\n\\n\"I am aweary, good strangers, I pray you lead me to her grave.\"\\n\\nAll the smile vanished away, every cheek blanched, Catharina sunk to the\\nground in a swoon.\\n\\nAll day the people went about the castle with troubled faces, and\\ncommuned together in undertones. A painful hush pervaded the place which\\nhad lately been so full of cheery life. Each in his turn tried to arouse\\nConrad out of his hallucination and bring him to himself; but all the\\nanswer any got was a meek, bewildered stare, and then the words:\\n\\n\"Good stranger, I have no friends, all are at rest these many years;\\nye speak me fair, ye mean me well, but I know ye not; I am alone and\\nforlorn in the world--prithee lead me to her grave.\"\\n\\nDuring two years Conrad spent his days, from the early morning till the\\nnight, under the linden tree, mourning over the imaginary grave of his\\nCatharina. Catharina was the only company of the harmless madman. He was\\nvery friendly toward her because, as he said, in some ways she reminded\\nhim of his Catharina whom he had lost \"fifty years ago.\" He often said:\\n\\n\"She was so gay, so happy-hearted--but you never smile; and always when\\nyou think I am not looking, you cry.\"\\n\\nWhen Conrad died, they buried him under the linden, according to his\\ndirections, so that he might rest \"near his poor Catharina.\" Then\\nCatharina sat under the linden alone, every day and all day long, a\\ngreat many years, speaking to no one, and never smiling; and at last her\\nlong repentance was rewarded with death, and she was buried by Conrad\\'s\\nside.\\n\\nHarris pleased the captain by saying it was good legend; and pleased him\\nfurther by adding:\\n\\n\"Now that I have seen this mighty tree, vigorous with its four hundred\\nyears, I feel a desire to believe the legend for _its_ sake; so I will\\nhumor the desire, and consider that the tree really watches over those\\npoor hearts and feels a sort of human tenderness for them.\"\\n\\nWe returned to Necharsteinach, plunged our hot heads into the trough at\\nthe town pump, and then went to the hotel and ate our trout dinner in\\nleisurely comfort, in the garden, with the beautiful Neckar flowing at\\nour feet, the quaint Dilsberg looming beyond, and the graceful towers\\nand battlements of a couple of medieval castles (called the \"Swallow\\'s\\nNest\" [1] and \"The Brothers.\") assisting the rugged scenery of a bend\\nof the river down to our right. We got to sea in season to make the\\neight-mile run to Heidelberg before the night shut down. We sailed by\\nthe hotel in the mellow glow of sunset, and came slashing down with\\nthe mad current into the narrow passage between the dikes. I believed I\\ncould shoot the bridge myself, and I went to the forward triplet of logs\\nand relieved the pilot of his pole and his responsibility.\\n\\n1. The seeker after information is referred to Appendix E for our\\ncaptain\\'s legend of the \"Swallow\\'s Nest\" and \"The Brothers.\"\\n\\nWe went tearing along in a most exhilarating way, and I performed the\\ndelicate duties of my office very well indeed for a first attempt;\\nbut perceiving, presently, that I really was going to shoot the bridge\\nitself instead of the archway under it, I judiciously stepped ashore.\\nThe next moment I had my long-coveted desire: I saw a raft wrecked. It\\nhit the pier in the center and went all to smash and scatteration like a\\nbox of matches struck by lightning.\\n\\nI was the only one of our party who saw this grand sight; the others\\nwere attitudinizing, for the benefit of the long rank of young ladies\\nwho were promenading on the bank, and so they lost it. But I helped to\\nfish them out of the river, down below the bridge, and then described it\\nto them as well as I could.\\n\\nThey were not interested, though. They said they were wet and felt\\nridiculous and did not care anything for descriptions of scenery. The\\nyoung ladies, and other people, crowded around and showed a great deal\\nof sympathy, but that did not help matters; for my friends said they did\\nnot want sympathy, they wanted a back alley and solitude.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XX\\n\\n[My Precious, Priceless Tear-Jug]\\n\\nNext morning brought good news--our trunks had arrived from Hamburg\\nat last. Let this be a warning to the reader. The Germans are very\\nconscientious, and this trait makes them very particular. Therefore if\\nyou tell a German you want a thing done immediately, he takes you\\nat your word; he thinks you mean what you say; so he does that thing\\nimmediately--according to his idea of immediately--which is about a\\nweek; that is, it is a week if it refers to the building of a garment,\\nor it is an hour and a half if it refers to the cooking of a trout. Very\\nwell; if you tell a German to send your trunk to you by \"slow freight,\"\\nhe takes you at your word; he sends it by \"slow freight,\" and you\\ncannot imagine how long you will go on enlarging your admiration of the\\nexpressiveness of that phrase in the German tongue, before you get that\\ntrunk. The hair on my trunk was soft and thick and youthful, when I\\ngot it ready for shipment in Hamburg; it was baldheaded when it reached\\nHeidelberg. However, it was still sound, that was a comfort, it was\\nnot battered in the least; the baggagemen seemed to be conscientiously\\ncareful, in Germany, of the baggage entrusted to their hands. There\\nwas nothing now in the way of our departure, therefore we set about our\\npreparations.\\n\\nNaturally my chief solicitude was about my collection of Ceramics. Of\\ncourse I could not take it with me, that would be inconvenient, and\\ndangerous besides. I took advice, but the best brick-a-brackers were\\ndivided as to the wisest course to pursue; some said pack the collection\\nand warehouse it; others said try to get it into the Grand Ducal Museum\\nat Mannheim for safe keeping. So I divided the collection, and followed\\nthe advice of both parties. I set aside, for the Museum, those articles\\nwhich were the most frail and precious.\\n\\nAmong these was my Etruscan tear-jug. I have made a little sketch of\\nit here; that thing creeping up the side is not a bug, it is a hole.\\nI bought this tear-jug of a dealer in antiquities for four hundred and\\nfifty dollars. It is very rare. The man said the Etruscans used to keep\\ntears or something in these things, and that it was very hard to get\\nhold of a broken one, now.\\n\\nI also set aside my Henri II. plate. See sketch from my pencil; it is\\nin the main correct, though I think I have foreshortened one end of it\\na little too much, perhaps. This is very fine and rare; the shape is\\nexceedingly beautiful and unusual. It has wonderful decorations on it,\\nbut I am not able to reproduce them. It cost more than the tear-jug, as\\nthe dealer said there was not another plate just like it in the\\nworld. He said there was much false Henri II ware around, but that the\\ngenuineness of this piece was unquestionable.\\n\\nHe showed me its pedigree, or its history, if you please; it was a\\ndocument which traced this plate\\'s movements all the way down from its\\nbirth--showed who bought it, from whom, and what he paid for it--from\\nthe first buyer down to me, whereby I saw that it had gone steadily up\\nfrom thirty-five cents to seven hundred dollars. He said that the whole\\nCeramic world would be informed that it was now in my possession and\\nwould make a note of it, with the price paid. [Figure 8]\\n\\nThere were Masters in those days, but, alas--it is not so now. Of course\\nthe main preciousness of this piece lies in its color; it is that old\\nsensuous, pervading, ramifying, interpolating, transboreal blue which is\\nthe despair of modern art. The little sketch which I have made of this\\ngem cannot and does not do it justice, since I have been obliged to\\nleave out the color. But I\\'ve got the expression, though.\\n\\nHowever, I must not be frittering away the reader\\'s time with these\\ndetails. I did not intend to go into any detail at all, at first, but\\nit is the failing of the true ceramiker, or the true devotee in any\\ndepartment of brick-a-brackery, that once he gets his tongue or his pen\\nstarted on his darling theme, he cannot well stop until he drops from\\nexhaustion. He has no more sense of the flight of time than has any\\nother lover when talking of his sweetheart. The very \"marks\" on the\\nbottom of a piece of rare crockery are able to throw me into a gibbering\\necstasy; and I could forsake a drowning relative to help dispute about\\nwhether the stopple of a departed Buon Retiro scent-bottle was genuine\\nor spurious.\\n\\nMany people say that for a male person, bric-a-brac hunting is about as\\nrobust a business as making doll-clothes, or decorating Japanese pots\\nwith decalcomania butterflies would be, and these people fling mud at\\nthe elegant Englishman, Byng, who wrote a book called _The Bric-a-brac\\nHunter_, and make fun of him for chasing around after what they choose\\nto call \"his despicable trifles\"; and for \"gushing\" over these trifles;\\nand for exhibiting his \"deep infantile delight\" in what they call his\\n\"tuppenny collection of beggarly trivialities\"; and for beginning his\\nbook with a picture of himself seated, in a \"sappy, self-complacent\\nattitude, in the midst of his poor little ridiculous bric-a-brac junk\\nshop.\"\\n\\nIt is easy to say these things; it is easy to revile us, easy to despise\\nus; therefore, let these people rail on; they cannot feel as Byng and\\nI feel--it is their loss, not ours. For my part I am content to be a\\nbrick-a-bracker and a ceramiker--more, I am proud to be so named. I am\\nproud to know that I lose my reason as immediately in the presence of a\\nrare jug with an illustrious mark on the bottom of it, as if I had\\njust emptied that jug. Very well; I packed and stored a part of my\\ncollection, and the rest of it I placed in the care of the Grand Ducal\\nMuseum in Mannheim, by permission. My Old Blue China Cat remains there\\nyet. I presented it to that excellent institution.\\n\\nI had but one misfortune with my things. An egg which I had kept back\\nfrom breakfast that morning, was broken in packing. It was a great pity.\\nI had shown it to the best connoisseurs in Heidelberg, and they all said\\nit was an antique. We spent a day or two in farewell visits, and then\\nleft for Baden-Baden. We had a pleasant trip to it, for the Rhine valley\\nis always lovely. The only trouble was that the trip was too short. If\\nI remember rightly it only occupied a couple of hours, therefore I judge\\nthat the distance was very little, if any, over fifty miles. We\\nquitted the train at Oos, and walked the entire remaining distance to\\nBaden-Baden, with the exception of a lift of less than an hour which\\nwe got on a passing wagon, the weather being exhaustingly warm. We came\\ninto town on foot.\\n\\nOne of the first persons we encountered, as we walked up the street,\\nwas the Rev. Mr. ------, an old friend from America--a lucky encounter,\\nindeed, for his is a most gentle, refined, and sensitive nature, and his\\ncompany and companionship are a genuine refreshment. We knew he had been\\nin Europe some time, but were not at all expecting to run across him.\\nBoth parties burst forth into loving enthusiasms, and Rev. Mr. ------\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"I have got a brimful reservoir of talk to pour out on you, and an empty\\none ready and thirsting to receive what you have got; we will sit up\\ntill midnight and have a good satisfying interchange, for I leave here\\nearly in the morning.\" We agreed to that, of course.\\n\\nI had been vaguely conscious, for a while, of a person who was walking\\nin the street abreast of us; I had glanced furtively at him once or\\ntwice, and noticed that he was a fine, large, vigorous young fellow,\\nwith an open, independent countenance, faintly shaded with a pale and\\neven almost imperceptible crop of early down, and that he was clothed\\nfrom head to heel in cool and enviable snow-white linen. I thought I had\\nalso noticed that his head had a sort of listening tilt to it. Now about\\nthis time the Rev. Mr. ------ said:\\n\\n\"The sidewalk is hardly wide enough for three, so I will walk behind;\\nbut keep the talk going, keep the talk going, there\\'s no time to lose,\\nand you may be sure I will do my share.\" He ranged himself behind us,\\nand straightway that stately snow-white young fellow closed up to the\\nsidewalk alongside him, fetched him a cordial slap on the shoulder with\\nhis broad palm, and sung out with a hearty cheeriness:\\n\\n\"_Americans_ for two-and-a-half and the money up! _Hey_?\"\\n\\nThe Reverend winced, but said mildly:\\n\\n\"Yes--we are Americans.\"\\n\\n\"Lord love you, you can just bet that\\'s what _I_ am, every time! Put it\\nthere!\"\\n\\nHe held out his Sahara of his palm, and the Reverend laid his diminutive\\nhand in it, and got so cordial a shake that we heard his glove burst\\nunder it.\\n\\n\"Say, didn\\'t I put you up right?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\n\\n\"Sho! I spotted you for _my_ kind the minute I heard your clack. You\\nbeen over here long?\"\\n\\n\"About four months. Have you been over long?\"\\n\\n\"_Long_? Well, I should say so! Going on two _years_, by geeminy! Say,\\nare you homesick?\"\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t say that I am. Are you?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _hell_, yes!\" This with immense enthusiasm.\\n\\nThe Reverend shrunk a little, in his clothes, and we were aware, rather\\nby instinct than otherwise, that he was throwing out signals of distress\\nto us; but we did not interfere or try to succor him, for we were quite\\nhappy.\\n\\nThe young fellow hooked his arm into the Reverend\\'s, now, with the\\nconfiding and grateful air of a waif who has been longing for a friend,\\nand a sympathetic ear, and a chance to lisp once more the sweet accents\\nof the mother-tongue--and then he limbered up the muscles of his mouth\\nand turned himself loose--and with such a relish! Some of his words were\\nnot Sunday-school words, so I am obliged to put blanks where they occur.\\n\\n\"Yes indeedy! If _I_ ain\\'t an American there _ain\\'t_ any Americans,\\nthat\\'s all. And when I heard you fellows gassing away in the good old\\nAmerican language, I\\'m ------ if it wasn\\'t all I could do to keep from\\nhugging you! My tongue\\'s all warped with trying to curl it around these\\n------ forsaken wind-galled nine-jointed German words here; now I _tell_\\nyou it\\'s awful good to lay it over a Christian word once more and kind\\nof let the old taste soak it. I\\'m from western New York. My name is\\nCholley Adams. I\\'m a student, you know. Been here going on two years.\\nI\\'m learning to be a horse-doctor! I _like_ that part of it, you know,\\nbut ------these people, they won\\'t learn a fellow in his own\\nlanguage, they make him learn in German; so before I could tackle the\\nhorse-doctoring I had to tackle this miserable language.\\n\\n\"First off, I thought it would certainly give me the botts, but I don\\'t\\nmind now. I\\'ve got it where the hair\\'s short, I think; and dontchuknow,\\nthey made me learn Latin, too. Now between you and me, I wouldn\\'t give a\\n------for all the Latin that was ever jabbered; and the first thing _I_\\ncalculate to do when I get through, is to just sit down and forget it.\\n\\'Twon\\'t take me long, and I don\\'t mind the time, anyway. And I tell\\nyou what! the difference between school-teaching over yonder and\\nschool-teaching over here--sho! _we_ don\\'t know anything about it! Here\\nyou\\'ve got to peg and peg and peg and there just ain\\'t any let-up--and\\nwhat you learn here, you\\'ve got to _know_, dontchuknow--or else you\\'ll\\nhave one of these ------ spavined, spectacles, ring-boned, knock-kneed\\nold professors in your hair. I\\'ve been here long _enough_, and I\\'m\\ngetting blessed tired of it, mind I _tell_ you. The old man wrote me\\nthat he was coming over in June, and said he\\'d take me home in August,\\nwhether I was done with my education or not, but durn him, he didn\\'t\\ncome; never said why; just sent me a hamper of Sunday-school books, and\\ntold me to be good, and hold on a while. I don\\'t take to Sunday-school\\nbooks, dontchuknow--I don\\'t hanker after them when I can get pie--but I\\n_read_ them, anyway, because whatever the old man tells me to do, that\\'s\\nthe thing that I\\'m a-going to _do_, or tear something, you know. I\\nbuckled in and read all those books, because he wanted me to; but that\\nkind of thing don\\'t excite _me_, I like something _hearty_. But I\\'m\\nawful homesick. I\\'m homesick from ear-socket to crupper, and from\\ncrupper to hock-joint; but it ain\\'t any use, I\\'ve got to stay here, till\\nthe old man drops the rag and give the word--yes, _sir_, right here\\nin this ------ country I\\'ve got to linger till the old man says\\n_come_!--and you bet your bottom dollar, Johnny, it _ain\\'t_ just as easy\\nas it is for a cat to have twins!\"\\n\\nAt the end of this profane and cordial explosion he fetched a prodigious\\n\"WHOOSH!\" to relieve his lungs and make recognition of the heat, and\\nthen he straightway dived into his narrative again for \"Johnny\\'s\"\\nbenefit, beginning, \"Well, ------it ain\\'t any use talking, some of those\\nold American words DO have a kind of a bully swing to them; a man can\\n_express_ himself with \\'em--a man can get at what he wants to _say_,\\ndontchuknow.\"\\n\\nWhen we reached our hotel and it seemed that he was about to lose the\\nReverend, he showed so much sorrow, and begged so hard and so earnestly\\nthat the Reverend\\'s heart was not hard enough to hold out against the\\npleadings--so he went away with the parent-honoring student, like a\\nright Christian, and took supper with him in his lodgings, and sat in\\nthe surf-beat of his slang and profanity till near midnight, and then\\nleft him--left him pretty well talked out, but grateful \"clear down\\nto his frogs,\" as he expressed it. The Reverend said it had transpired\\nduring the interview that \"Cholley\" Adams\\'s father was an extensive\\ndealer in horses in western New York; this accounted for Cholley\\'s\\nchoice of a profession. The Reverend brought away a pretty high opinion\\nof Cholley as a manly young fellow, with stuff in him for a useful\\ncitizen; he considered him rather a rough gem, but a gem, nevertheless.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI\\n\\n[Insolent Shopkeepers and Gabbling Americans]\\n\\nBaden-Baden sits in the lap of the hills, and the natural and artificial\\nbeauties of the surroundings are combined effectively and charmingly.\\nThe level strip of ground which stretches through and beyond the town is\\nlaid out in handsome pleasure grounds, shaded by noble trees and adorned\\nat intervals with lofty and sparkling fountain-jets. Thrice a day a fine\\nband makes music in the public promenade before the Conversation\\nHouse, and in the afternoon and evening that locality is populous with\\nfashionably dressed people of both sexes, who march back and forth past\\nthe great music-stand and look very much bored, though they make a\\nshow of feeling otherwise. It seems like a rather aimless and stupid\\nexistence. A good many of these people are there for a real purpose,\\nhowever; they are racked with rheumatism, and they are there to stew it\\nout in the hot baths. These invalids looked melancholy enough, limping\\nabout on their canes and crutches, and apparently brooding over all\\nsorts of cheerless things. People say that Germany, with her damp stone\\nhouses, is the home of rheumatism. If that is so, Providence must have\\nforeseen that it would be so, and therefore filled the land with the\\nhealing baths. Perhaps no other country is so generously supplied with\\nmedicinal springs as Germany. Some of these baths are good for one\\nailment, some for another; and again, peculiar ailments are conquered\\nby combining the individual virtues of several different baths. For\\ninstance, for some forms of disease, the patient drinks the native hot\\nwater of Baden-Baden, with a spoonful of salt from the Carlsbad springs\\ndissolved in it. That is not a dose to be forgotten right away.\\n\\nThey don\\'t _sell_ this hot water; no, you go into the great Trinkhalle,\\nand stand around, first on one foot and then on the other, while two or\\nthree young girls sit pottering at some sort of ladylike sewing-work\\nin your neighborhood and can\\'t seem to see you--polite as three-dollar\\nclerks in government offices.\\n\\nBy and by one of these rises painfully, and \"stretches\"--stretches fists\\nand body heavenward till she raises her heels from the floor, at the\\nsame time refreshing herself with a yawn of such comprehensiveness that\\nthe bulk of her face disappears behind her upper lip and one is able to\\nsee how she is constructed inside--then she slowly closes her\\ncavern, brings down her fists and her heels, comes languidly forward,\\ncontemplates you contemptuously, draws you a glass of hot water and sets\\nit down where you can get it by reaching for it. You take it and say:\\n\\n\"How much?\"--and she returns you, with elaborate indifference, a\\nbeggar\\'s answer:\\n\\n\"_Nach beliebe_\" (what you please.)\\n\\nThis thing of using the common beggar\\'s trick and the common beggar\\'s\\nshibboleth to put you on your liberality when you were expecting a\\nsimple straightforward commercial transaction, adds a little to your\\nprospering sense of irritation. You ignore her reply, and ask again:\\n\\n\"How much?\"\\n\\n--and she calmly, indifferently, repeats:\\n\\n\"_Nach Beliebe_.\"\\n\\nYou are getting angry, but you are trying not to show it; you resolve\\nto keep on asking your question till she changes her answer, or at least\\nher annoyingly indifferent manner. Therefore, if your case be like mine,\\nyou two fools stand there, and without perceptible emotion of any kind,\\nor any emphasis on any syllable, you look blandly into each other\\'s\\neyes, and hold the following idiotic conversation:\\n\\n\"How much?\"\\n\\n\"_Nach beliebe_.\"\\n\\n\"How much?\"\\n\\n\"_Nach beliebe_.\"\\n\\n\"How much?\"\\n\\n\"NACH BELIEBE.\"\\n\\n\"How much?\"\\n\\n\"_Nach beliebe_.\"\\n\\n\"How much?\"\\n\\n\"_Nach beliebe_.\"\\n\\n\"How much?\"\\n\\n\"_Nach beliebe_.\"\\n\\nI do not know what another person would have done, but at this point I\\ngave up; that cast-iron indifference, that tranquil contemptuousness,\\nconquered me, and I struck my colors. Now I knew she was used to\\nreceiving about a penny from manly people who care nothing about the\\nopinions of scullery-maids, and about tuppence from moral cowards; but\\nI laid a silver twenty-five cent piece within her reach and tried to\\nshrivel her up with this sarcastic speech:\\n\\n\"If it isn\\'t enough, will you stoop sufficiently from your official\\ndignity to say so?\"\\n\\nShe did not shrivel. Without deigning to look at me at all, she\\nlanguidly lifted the coin and bit it!--to see if it was good. Then she\\nturned her back and placidly waddled to her former roost again, tossing\\nthe money into an open till as she went along. She was victor to the\\nlast, you see.\\n\\nI have enlarged upon the ways of this girl because they are typical;\\nher manners are the manners of a goodly number of the Baden-Baden\\nshopkeepers. The shopkeeper there swindles you if he can, and insults\\nyou whether he succeeds in swindling you or not. The keepers of baths\\nalso take great and patient pains to insult you. The frowsy woman who\\nsat at the desk in the lobby of the great Friederichsbad and sold bath\\ntickets, not only insulted me twice every day, with rigid fidelity\\nto her great trust, but she took trouble enough to cheat me out of a\\nshilling, one day, to have fairly entitled her to ten. Baden-Baden\\'s\\nsplendid gamblers are gone, only her microscopic knaves remain.\\n\\nAn English gentleman who had been living there several years, said:\\n\\n\"If you could disguise your nationality, you would not find any\\ninsolence here. These shopkeepers detest the English and despise the\\nAmericans; they are rude to both, more especially to ladies of your\\nnationality and mine. If these go shopping without a gentleman or\\na man-servant, they are tolerably sure to be subjected to petty\\ninsolences--insolences of manner and tone, rather than word, though\\nwords that are hard to bear are not always wanting. I know of an\\ninstance where a shopkeeper tossed a coin back to an American lady with\\nthe remark, snappishly uttered, \\'We don\\'t take French money here.\\' And\\nI know of a case where an English lady said to one of these shopkeepers,\\n\\'Don\\'t you think you ask too much for this article?\\' and he replied with\\nthe question, \\'Do you think you are obliged to buy it?\\' However, these\\npeople are not impolite to Russians or Germans. And as to rank, they\\nworship that, for they have long been used to generals and nobles. If\\nyou wish to see what abysses servility can descend, present yourself\\nbefore a Baden-Baden shopkeeper in the character of a Russian prince.\"\\n\\nIt is an inane town, filled with sham, and petty fraud, and snobbery,\\nbut the baths are good. I spoke with many people, and they were all\\nagreed in that. I had the twinges of rheumatism unceasingly during three\\nyears, but the last one departed after a fortnight\\'s bathing there,\\nand I have never had one since. I fully believe I left my rheumatism in\\nBaden-Baden. Baden-Baden is welcome to it. It was little, but it was\\nall I had to give. I would have preferred to leave something that was\\ncatching, but it was not in my power.\\n\\nThere are several hot springs there, and during two thousand years they\\nhave poured forth a never-diminishing abundance of the healing water.\\nThis water is conducted in pipe to the numerous bath-houses, and is\\nreduced to an endurable temperature by the addition of cold water. The\\nnew Friederichsbad is a very large and beautiful building, and in it one\\nmay have any sort of bath that has ever been invented, and with all\\nthe additions of herbs and drugs that his ailment may need or that the\\nphysician of the establishment may consider a useful thing to put into\\nthe water. You go there, enter the great door, get a bow graduated to\\nyour style and clothes from the gorgeous portier, and a bath ticket and\\nan insult from the frowsy woman for a quarter; she strikes a bell and\\na serving-man conducts you down a long hall and shuts you into a\\ncommodious room which has a washstand, a mirror, a bootjack, and a sofa\\nin it, and there you undress at your leisure.\\n\\nThe room is divided by a great curtain; you draw this curtain aside, and\\nfind a large white marble bathtub, with its rim sunk to the level of the\\nfloor, and with three white marble steps leading down to it. This tub\\nis full of water which is as clear as crystal, and is tempered to 28\\ndegrees Re\\'aumur (about 95 degrees Fahrenheit). Sunk into the floor, by\\nthe tub, is a covered copper box which contains some warm towels and a\\nsheet. You look fully as white as an angel when you are stretched out\\nin that limpid bath. You remain in it ten minutes, the first time,\\nand afterward increase the duration from day to day, till you reach\\ntwenty-five or thirty minutes. There you stop. The appointments of the\\nplace are so luxurious, the benefit so marked, the price so moderate,\\nand the insults so sure, that you very soon find yourself adoring the\\nFriederichsbad and infesting it.\\n\\nWe had a plain, simple, unpretending, good hotel, in Baden-Baden--the\\nHtel de France--and alongside my room I had a giggling, cackling,\\nchattering family who always went to bed just two hours after me and\\nalways got up two hours ahead of me. But this is common in German\\nhotels; the people generally go to bed long after eleven and get up\\nlong before eight. The partitions convey sound like a drum-head, and\\neverybody knows it; but no matter, a German family who are all kindness\\nand consideration in the daytime make apparently no effort to moderate\\ntheir noises for your benefit at night. They will sing, laugh, and talk\\nloudly, and bang furniture around in a most pitiless way. If you knock\\non your wall appealingly, they will quiet down and discuss the matter\\nsoftly among themselves for a moment--then, like the mice, they fall to\\npersecuting you again, and as vigorously as before. They keep cruelly\\nlate and early hours, for such noisy folk.\\n\\nOf course, when one begins to find fault with foreign people\\'s ways, he\\nis very likely to get a reminder to look nearer home, before he gets far\\nwith it. I open my note-book to see if I can find some more information\\nof a valuable nature about Baden-Baden, and the first thing I fall upon\\nis this:\\n\\n\"_Baden-Baden_ (no date). Lot of vociferous Americans at breakfast\\nthis morning. Talking _at_ everybody, while pretending to talk among\\nthemselves. On their first travels, manifestly. Showing off. The usual\\nsigns--airy, easy-going references to grand distances and foreign\\nplaces. \\'Well _good_-by, old fellow--if I don\\'t run across you in Italy,\\nyou hunt me up in London before you sail.\\'\"\\n\\nThe next item which I find in my note-book is this one:\\n\\n\"The fact that a band of 6,000 Indians are now murdering our\\nfrontiersmen at their impudent leisure, and that we are only able\\nto send 1,200 soldiers against them, is utilized here to discourage\\nemigration to America. The common people think the Indians are in New\\nJersey.\"\\n\\nThis is a new and peculiar argument against keeping our army down to a\\nridiculous figure in the matter of numbers. It is rather a striking\\none, too. I have not distorted the truth in saying that the facts in\\nthe above item, about the army and the Indians, are made use of to\\ndiscourage emigration to America. That the common people should be\\nrather foggy in their geography, and foggy as to the location of the\\nIndians, is a matter for amusement, maybe, but not of surprise.\\n\\nThere is an interesting old cemetery in Baden-Baden, and we spent\\nseveral pleasant hours in wandering through it and spelling out the\\ninscriptions on the aged tombstones. Apparently after a man has laid\\nthere a century or two, and has had a good many people buried on top\\nof him, it is considered that his tombstone is not needed by him any\\nlonger. I judge so from the fact that hundreds of old gravestones have\\nbeen removed from the graves and placed against the inner walls of the\\ncemetery. What artists they had in the old times! They chiseled angels\\nand cherubs and devils and skeletons on the tombstones in the most\\nlavish and generous way--as to supply--but curiously grotesque and\\noutlandish as to form. It is not always easy to tell which of the\\nfigures belong among the blest and which of them among the opposite\\nparty. But there was an inscription, in French, on one of those old\\nstones, which was quaint and pretty, and was plainly not the work of any\\nother than a poet. It was to this effect:\\n\\nHere Reposes in God, Caroline de Clery, a Religieuse of St. Denis aged\\n83 years--and blind. The light was restored to her in Baden the 5th of\\nJanuary, 1839\\n\\nWe made several excursions on foot to the neighboring villages, over\\nwinding and beautiful roads and through enchanting woodland scenery.\\nThe woods and roads were similar to those at Heidelberg, but not\\nso bewitching. I suppose that roads and woods which are up to the\\nHeidelberg mark are rare in the world.\\n\\nOnce we wandered clear away to La Favorita Palace, which is several\\nmiles from Baden-Baden. The grounds about the palace were fine; the\\npalace was a curiosity. It was built by a Margravine in 1725, and\\nremains as she left it at her death. We wandered through a great many\\nof its rooms, and they all had striking peculiarities of decoration.\\nFor instance, the walls of one room were pretty completely covered\\nwith small pictures of the Margravine in all conceivable varieties of\\nfanciful costumes, some of them male.\\n\\nThe walls of another room were covered with grotesquely and elaborately\\nfigured hand-wrought tapestry. The musty ancient beds remained in the\\nchambers, and their quilts and curtains and canopies were decorated with\\ncurious handwork, and the walls and ceilings frescoed with historical\\nand mythological scenes in glaring colors. There was enough crazy and\\nrotten rubbish in the building to make a true brick-a-bracker green with\\nenvy. A painting in the dining-hall verged upon the indelicate--but then\\nthe Margravine was herself a trifle indelicate.\\n\\nIt is in every way a wildly and picturesquely decorated house, and\\nbrimful of interest as a reflection of the character and tastes of that\\nrude bygone time.\\n\\nIn the grounds, a few rods from the palace, stands the Margravine\\'s\\nchapel, just as she left it--a coarse wooden structure, wholly barren\\nof ornament. It is said that the Margravine would give herself up to\\ndebauchery and exceedingly fast living for several months at a time,\\nand then retire to this miserable wooden den and spend a few months in\\nrepenting and getting ready for another good time. She was a devoted\\nCatholic, and was perhaps quite a model sort of a Christian as\\nChristians went then, in high life.\\n\\nTradition says she spent the last two years of her life in the strange\\nden I have been speaking of, after having indulged herself in one final,\\ntriumphant, and satisfying spree. She shut herself up there, without\\ncompany, and without even a servant, and so abjured and forsook the\\nworld. In her little bit of a kitchen she did her own cooking; she wore\\na hair shirt next the skin, and castigated herself with whips--these\\naids to grace are exhibited there yet. She prayed and told her beads,\\nin another little room, before a waxen Virgin niched in a little box\\nagainst the wall; she bedded herself like a slave.\\n\\nIn another small room is an unpainted wooden table, and behind it sit\\nhalf-life-size waxen figures of the Holy Family, made by the very worst\\nartist that ever lived, perhaps, and clothed in gaudy, flimsy drapery.\\n[1] The margravine used to bring her meals to this table and _dine with\\nthe holy family_. What an idea that was! What a grisly spectacle it must\\nhave been! Imagine it: Those rigid, shock-headed figures, with corpsy\\ncomplexions and fish glass eyes, occupying one side of the table in the\\nconstrained attitudes and dead fixedness that distinguish all men that\\nare born of wax, and this wrinkled, smoldering old fire-eater occupying\\nthe other side, mumbling her prayers and munching her sausages in the\\nghostly stillness and shadowy indistinctness of a winter twilight. It\\nmakes one feel crawly even to think of it.\\n\\n[1] The Savior was represented as a lad of about fifteen years of age.\\nThis figure had lost one eye.\\n\\nIn this sordid place, and clothed, bedded, and fed like a pauper, this\\nstrange princess lived and worshiped during two years, and in it she\\ndied. Two or three hundred years ago, this would have made the poor den\\nholy ground; and the church would have set up a miracle-factory there\\nand made plenty of money out of it. The den could be moved into some\\nportions of France and made a good property even now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXII\\n\\n[The Black Forest and Its Treasures]\\n\\nFrom Baden-Baden we made the customary trip into the Black Forest. We\\nwere on foot most of the time. One cannot describe those noble woods,\\nnor the feeling with which they inspire him. A feature of the feeling,\\nhowever, is a deep sense of contentment; another feature of it is a\\nbuoyant, boyish gladness; and a third and very conspicuous feature of\\nit is one\\'s sense of the remoteness of the work-day world and his entire\\nemancipation from it and its affairs.\\n\\nThose woods stretch unbroken over a vast region; and everywhere they are\\nsuch dense woods, and so still, and so piney and fragrant. The stems of\\nthe trees are trim and straight, and in many places all the ground is\\nhidden for miles under a thick cushion of moss of a vivid green color,\\nwith not a decayed or ragged spot in its surface, and not a fallen leaf\\nor twig to mar its immaculate tidiness. A rich cathedral gloom pervades\\nthe pillared aisles; so the stray flecks of sunlight that strike a trunk\\nhere and a bough yonder are strongly accented, and when they strike the\\nmoss they fairly seem to burn. But the weirdest effect, and the most\\nenchanting is that produced by the diffused light of the low afternoon\\nsun; no single ray is able to pierce its way in, then, but the diffused\\nlight takes color from moss and foliage, and pervades the place like\\na faint, green-tinted mist, the theatrical fire of fairyland. The\\nsuggestion of mystery and the supernatural which haunts the forest at\\nall times is intensified by this unearthly glow.\\n\\nWe found the Black Forest farmhouses and villages all that the Black\\nForest stories have pictured them. The first genuine specimen which\\nwe came upon was the mansion of a rich farmer and member of the Common\\nCouncil of the parish or district. He was an important personage in the\\nland and so was his wife also, of course.\\n\\nHis daughter was the \"catch\" of the region, and she may be already\\nentering into immortality as the heroine of one of Auerbach\\'s novels,\\nfor all I know. We shall see, for if he puts her in I shall recognize\\nher by her Black Forest clothes, and her burned complexion, her plump\\nfigure, her fat hands, her dull expression, her gentle spirit,\\nher generous feet, her bonnetless head, and the plaited tails of\\nhemp-colored hair hanging down her back.\\n\\nThe house was big enough for a hotel; it was a hundred feet long and\\nfifty wide, and ten feet high, from ground to eaves; but from the eaves\\nto the comb of the mighty roof was as much as forty feet, or maybe even\\nmore. This roof was of ancient mud-colored straw thatch a foot thick,\\nand was covered all over, except in a few trifling spots, with a\\nthriving and luxurious growth of green vegetation, mainly moss. The\\nmossless spots were places where repairs had been made by the insertion\\nof bright new masses of yellow straw. The eaves projected far down, like\\nsheltering, hospitable wings. Across the gable that fronted the road,\\nand about ten feet above the ground, ran a narrow porch, with a wooden\\nrailing; a row of small windows filled with very small panes looked upon\\nthe porch. Above were two or three other little windows, one clear up\\nunder the sharp apex of the roof. Before the ground-floor door was a\\nhuge pile of manure. The door of the second-story room on the side of\\nthe house was open, and occupied by the rear elevation of a cow. Was\\nthis probably the drawing-room? All of the front half of the house from\\nthe ground up seemed to be occupied by the people, the cows, and the\\nchickens, and all the rear half by draught-animals and hay. But the\\nchief feature, all around this house, was the big heaps of manure.\\n\\nWe became very familiar with the fertilizer in the Forest. We fell\\nunconsciously into the habit of judging of a man\\'s station in life\\nby this outward and eloquent sign. Sometimes we said, \"Here is a poor\\ndevil, this is manifest.\" When we saw a stately accumulation, we said,\\n\"Here is a banker.\" When we encountered a country-seat surrounded by an\\nAlpine pomp of manure, we said, \"Doubtless a duke lives here.\"\\n\\nThe importance of this feature has not been properly magnified in the\\nBlack Forest stories. Manure is evidently the Black-Forester\\'s main\\ntreasure--his coin, his jewel, his pride, his Old Master, his ceramics,\\nhis bric-a-brac, his darling, his title to public consideration, envy,\\nveneration, and his first solicitude when he gets ready to make his\\nwill. The true Black Forest novel, if it is ever written, will be\\nskeletoned somewhat in this way:\\n\\nSKELETON FOR A BLACK FOREST NOVEL\\n\\nRich old farmer, named Huss.\\n\\nHas inherited great wealth of manure, and by diligence has added to it.\\nIt is double-starred in Baedeker. [1] The Black forest artist paints\\nit--his masterpiece. The king comes to see it. Gretchen Huss,\\ndaughter and heiress. Paul Hoch, young neighbor, suitor for Gretchen\\'s\\nhand--ostensibly; he really wants the manure.\\n\\nHoch has a good many cart-loads of the Black Forest currency himself,\\nand therefore is a good catch; but he is sordid, mean, and without\\nsentiment, whereas Gretchen is all sentiment and poetry. Hans Schmidt,\\nyoung neighbor, full of sentiment, full of poetry, loves Gretchen,\\nGretchen loves him. But he has no manure. Old Huss forbids him in the\\nhouse. His heart breaks, he goes away to die in the woods, far from the\\ncruel world--for he says, bitterly, \"What is man, without manure?\"\\n\\n1. When Baedeker\\'s guide-books mention a thing and put two stars (**)\\nafter it, it means well worth visiting. M.T.\\n\\n[Interval of six months.]\\n\\nPaul Hoch comes to old Huss and says, \"I am at last as rich as you\\nrequired--come and view the pile.\" Old Huss views it and says, \"It is\\nsufficient--take her and be happy,\"--meaning Gretchen.\\n\\n[Interval of two weeks.]\\n\\nWedding party assembled in old Huss\\'s drawing-room. Hoch placid and\\ncontent, Gretchen weeping over her hard fate. Enter old Huss\\'s head\\nbookkeeper. Huss says fiercely, \"I gave you three weeks to find out why\\nyour books don\\'t balance, and to prove that you are not a defaulter;\\nthe time is up--find me the missing property or you go to prison as\\na thief.\" Bookkeeper: \"I have found it.\" \"Where?\" Bookkeeper\\n(sternly--tragically): \"In the bridegroom\\'s pile!--behold the thief--see\\nhim blench and tremble!\" [Sensation.] Paul Hoch: \"Lost, lost!\"--falls\\nover the cow in a swoon and is handcuffed. Gretchen: \"Saved!\" Falls over\\nthe calf in a swoon of joy, but is caught in the arms of Hans Schmidt,\\nwho springs in at that moment. Old Huss: \"What, you here, varlet? Unhand\\nthe maid and quit the place.\" Hans (still supporting the insensible\\ngirl): \"Never! Cruel old man, know that I come with claims which even\\nyou cannot despise.\"\\n\\nHuss: \"_What_? Name them.\"\\n\\nHans: \"Listen then. The world has forsaken me, I forsook the world, I\\nwandered in the solitude of the forest, longing for death but finding\\nnone. I fed upon roots, and in my bitterness I dug for the bitterest,\\nloathing the sweeter kind. Digging, three days agone, I struck a manure\\nmine!--a Golconda, a limitless Bonanza, of solid manure! I can buy\\nyou _all_, and have mountain ranges of manure left! Ha-ha, _now_ thou\\nsmilest a smile!\" [Immense sensation.] Exhibition of specimens from the\\nmine. Old Huss (enthusiastically): \"Wake her up, shake her up, noble\\nyoung man, she is yours!\" Wedding takes place on the spot; bookkeeper\\nrestored to his office and emoluments; Paul Hoch led off to jail. The\\nBonanza king of the Black Forest lives to a good old age, blessed with\\nthe love of his wife and of his twenty-seven children, and the still\\nsweeter envy of everybody around.\\n\\nWe took our noon meal of fried trout one day at the Plow Inn, in a very\\npretty village (Ottenhoefen), and then went into the public room to rest\\nand smoke. There we found nine or ten Black Forest grandees assembled\\naround a table. They were the Common Council of the parish. They had\\ngathered there at eight o\\'clock that morning to elect a new member, and\\nthey had now been drinking beer four hours at the new member\\'s expense.\\n\\nThey were men of fifty or sixty years of age, with grave good-natured\\nfaces, and were all dressed in the costume made familiar to us by the\\nBlack Forest stories; broad, round-topped black felt hats with the brims\\ncurled up all round; long red waistcoats with large metal buttons, black\\nalpaca coats with the waists up between the shoulders. There were no\\nspeeches, there was but little talk, there were no frivolities; the\\nCouncil filled themselves gradually, steadily, but surely, with beer,\\nand conducted themselves with sedate decorum, as became men of position,\\nmen of influence, men of manure.\\n\\nWe had a hot afternoon tramp up the valley, along the grassy bank of a\\nrushing stream of clear water, past farmhouses, water-mills, and no end\\nof wayside crucifixes and saints and Virgins. These crucifixes, etc.,\\nare set up in memory of departed friends, by survivors, and are almost\\nas frequent as telegraph-poles are in other lands.\\n\\nWe followed the carriage-road, and had our usual luck; we traveled under\\na beating sun, and always saw the shade leave the shady places before we\\ncould get to them. In all our wanderings we seldom managed to strike\\na piece of road at its time for being shady. We had a particularly hot\\ntime of it on that particular afternoon, and with no comfort but what we\\ncould get out of the fact that the peasants at work away up on the steep\\nmountainsides above our heads were even worse off than we were. By and\\nby it became impossible to endure the intolerable glare and heat\\nany longer; so we struck across the ravine and entered the deep cool\\ntwilight of the forest, to hunt for what the guide-book called the \"old\\nroad.\"\\n\\nWe found an old road, and it proved eventually to be the right one,\\nthough we followed it at the time with the conviction that it was the\\nwrong one. If it was the wrong one there could be no use in hurrying;\\ntherefore we did not hurry, but sat down frequently on the soft moss and\\nenjoyed the restful quiet and shade of the forest solitudes. There\\nhad been distractions in the carriage-road--school-children, peasants,\\nwagons, troops of pedestrianizing students from all over Germany--but we\\nhad the old road to ourselves.\\n\\nNow and then, while we rested, we watched the laborious ant at his work.\\nI found nothing new in him--certainly nothing to change my opinion of\\nhim. It seems to me that in the matter of intellect the ant must be a\\nstrangely overrated bird. During many summers, now, I have watched him,\\nwhen I ought to have been in better business, and I have not yet come\\nacross a living ant that seemed to have any more sense than a dead one.\\nI refer to the ordinary ant, of course; I have had no experience of\\nthose wonderful Swiss and African ones which vote, keep drilled armies,\\nhold slaves, and dispute about religion. Those particular ants may be\\nall that the naturalist paints them, but I am persuaded that the\\naverage ant is a sham. I admit his industry, of course; he is the\\nhardest-working creature in the world--when anybody is looking--but\\nhis leather-headedness is the point I make against him. He goes out\\nforaging, he makes a capture, and then what does he do? Go home? No--he\\ngoes anywhere but home. He doesn\\'t know where home is. His home may be\\nonly three feet away--no matter, he can\\'t find it. He makes his capture,\\nas I have said; it is generally something which can be of no sort of\\nuse to himself or anybody else; it is usually seven times\\nbigger than it ought to be; he hunts out the awkwardest place\\nto take hold of it; he lifts it bodily up in the air by main force,\\nand starts; not toward home, but in the opposite direction;\\nnot calmly and wisely, but with a frantic haste which is wasteful of his\\nstrength; he fetches up against a pebble, and instead of going around\\nit, he climbs over it backward dragging his booty after him, tumbles\\ndown on the other side, jumps up in a passion, kicks the dust off his\\nclothes, moistens his hands, grabs his property viciously, yanks it this\\nway, then that, shoves it ahead of him a moment, turns tail and lugs it\\nafter him another moment, gets madder and madder, then presently hoists\\nit into the air and goes tearing away in an entirely new direction;\\ncomes to a weed; it never occurs to him to go around it; no, he must\\nclimb it; and he does climb it, dragging his worthless property to the\\ntop--which is as bright a thing to do as it would be for me to carry a\\nsack of flour from Heidelberg to Paris by way of Strasburg steeple; when\\nhe gets up there he finds that that is not the place; takes a cursory\\nglance at the scenery and either climbs down again or tumbles down, and\\nstarts off once more--as usual, in a new direction. At the end of half\\nan hour, he fetches up within six inches of the place he started from\\nand lays his burden down; meantime he has been over all the ground for\\ntwo yards around, and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across.\\nNow he wipes the sweat from his brow, strokes his limbs, and then\\nmarches aimlessly off, in as violently a hurry as ever. He does not\\nremember to have ever seen it before; he looks around to see which is\\nnot the way home, grabs his bundle and starts; he goes through the same\\nadventures he had before; finally stops to rest, and a friend comes\\nalong. Evidently the friend remarks that a last year\\'s grasshopper leg\\nis a very noble acquisition, and inquires where he got it.\\n\\nEvidently the proprietor does not remember exactly where he did get\\nit, but thinks he got it \"around here somewhere.\" Evidently the friend\\ncontracts to help him freight it home. Then, with a judgment peculiarly\\nantic (pun not intended), they take hold of opposite ends of that\\ngrasshopper leg and begin to tug with all their might in opposite\\ndirections. Presently they take a rest and confer together. They decide\\nthat something is wrong, they can\\'t make out what. Then they go at\\nit again, just as before. Same result. Mutual recriminations follow.\\nEvidently each accuses the other of being an obstructionist. They lock\\nthemselves together and chew each other\\'s jaws for a while; then they\\nroll and tumble on the ground till one loses a horn or a leg and has to\\nhaul off for repairs. They make up and go to work again in the same old\\ninsane way, but the crippled ant is at a disadvantage; tug as he may,\\nthe other one drags off the booty and him at the end of it. Instead\\nof giving up, he hangs on, and gets his shins bruised against every\\nobstruction that comes in the way. By and by, when that grasshopper leg\\nhas been dragged all over the same old ground once more, it is finally\\ndumped at about the spot where it originally lay, the two perspiring\\nants inspect it thoughtfully and decide that dried grasshopper legs\\nare a poor sort of property after all, and then each starts off in a\\ndifferent direction to see if he can\\'t find an old nail or something\\nelse that is heavy enough to afford entertainment and at the same time\\nvalueless enough to make an ant want to own it.\\n\\nThere in the Black Forest, on the mountainside, I saw an ant go through\\nwith such a performance as this with a dead spider of fully ten times\\nhis own weight. The spider was not quite dead, but too far gone to\\nresist. He had a round body the size of a pea. The little ant--observing\\nthat I was noticing--turned him on his back, sunk his fangs into his\\nthroat, lifted him into the air and started vigorously off with him,\\nstumbling over little pebbles, stepping on the spider\\'s legs and\\ntripping himself up, dragging him backward, shoving him bodily ahead,\\ndragging him up stones six inches high instead of going around them,\\nclimbing weeds twenty times his own height and jumping from their\\nsummits--and finally leaving him in the middle of the road to be\\nconfiscated by any other fool of an ant that wanted him. I measured the\\nground which this ass traversed, and arrived at the conclusion that what\\nhe had accomplished inside of twenty minutes would constitute some\\nsuch job as this--relatively speaking--for a man; to wit: to strap two\\neight-hundred-pound horses together, carry them eighteen hundred feet,\\nmainly over (not around) boulders averaging six feet high, and in the\\ncourse of the journey climb up and jump from the top of one precipice\\nlike Niagara, and three steeples, each a hundred and twenty feet high;\\nand then put the horses down, in an exposed place, without anybody to\\nwatch them, and go off to indulge in some other idiotic miracle for\\nvanity\\'s sake.\\n\\nScience has recently discovered that the ant does not lay up anything\\nfor winter use. This will knock him out of literature, to some extent.\\nHe does not work, except when people are looking, and only then when the\\nobserver has a green, naturalistic look, and seems to be taking notes.\\nThis amounts to deception, and will injure him for the Sunday-schools.\\nHe has not judgment enough to know what is good to eat from what isn\\'t.\\nThis amounts to ignorance, and will impair the world\\'s respect for\\nhim. He cannot stroll around a stump and find his way home again. This\\namounts to idiocy, and once the damaging fact is established, thoughtful\\npeople will cease to look up to him, the sentimental will cease to\\nfondle him. His vaunted industry is but a vanity and of no effect, since\\nhe never gets home with anything he starts with. This disposes of the\\nlast remnant of his reputation and wholly destroys his main usefulness\\nas a moral agent, since it will make the sluggard hesitate to go to him\\nany more. It is strange, beyond comprehension, that so manifest a humbug\\nas the ant has been able to fool so many nations and keep it up so many\\nages without being found out.\\n\\nThe ant is strong, but we saw another strong thing, where we had not\\nsuspected the presence of much muscular power before. A toadstool--that\\nvegetable which springs to full growth in a single night--had torn loose\\nand lifted a matted mass of pine needles and dirt of twice its own bulk\\ninto the air, and supported it there, like a column supporting a shed.\\nTen thousand toadstools, with the right purchase, could lift a man, I\\nsuppose. But what good would it do?\\n\\nAll our afternoon\\'s progress had been uphill. About five or half past we\\nreached the summit, and all of a sudden the dense curtain of the forest\\nparted and we looked down into a deep and beautiful gorge and out over a\\nwide panorama of wooded mountains with their summits shining in the sun\\nand their glade-furrowed sides dimmed with purple shade. The gorge under\\nour feet--called Allerheiligen--afforded room in the grassy level at its\\nhead for a cozy and delightful human nest, shut away from the world and\\nits botherations, and consequently the monks of the old times had not\\nfailed to spy it out; and here were the brown and comely ruins of their\\nchurch and convent to prove that priests had as fine an instinct seven\\nhundred years ago in ferreting out the choicest nooks and corners in a\\nland as priests have today.\\n\\nA big hotel crowds the ruins a little, now, and drives a brisk trade\\nwith summer tourists. We descended into the gorge and had a supper which\\nwould have been very satisfactory if the trout had not been boiled.\\nThe Germans are pretty sure to boil a trout or anything else if left to\\ntheir own devices. This is an argument of some value in support of the\\ntheory that they were the original colonists of the wild islands of the\\ncoast of Scotland. A schooner laden with oranges was wrecked upon one\\nof those islands a few years ago, and the gentle savages rendered the\\ncaptain such willing assistance that he gave them as many oranges as\\nthey wanted. Next day he asked them how they liked them. They shook\\ntheir heads and said:\\n\\n\"Baked, they were tough; and even boiled, they warn\\'t things for a\\nhungry man to hanker after.\"\\n\\nWe went down the glen after supper. It is beautiful--a mixture of sylvan\\nloveliness and craggy wildness. A limpid torrent goes whistling down\\nthe glen, and toward the foot of it winds through a narrow cleft between\\nlofty precipices and hurls itself over a succession of falls. After one\\npasses the last of these he has a backward glimpse at the falls which\\nis very pleasing--they rise in a seven-stepped stairway of foamy and\\nglittering cascades, and make a picture which is as charming as it is\\nunusual.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIII\\n\\n[Nicodemus Dodge and the Skeleton]\\n\\nWe were satisfied that we could walk to Oppenau in one day, now that\\nwe were in practice; so we set out the next morning after breakfast\\ndetermined to do it. It was all the way downhill, and we had the\\nloveliest summer weather for it. So we set the pedometer and then\\nstretched away on an easy, regular stride, down through the cloven\\nforest, drawing in the fragrant breath of the morning in deep refreshing\\ndraughts, and wishing we might never have anything to do forever but\\nwalk to Oppenau and keep on doing it and then doing it over again.\\n\\nNow, the true charm of pedestrianism does not lie in the walking, or\\nin the scenery, but in the talking. The walking is good to time the\\nmovement of the tongue by, and to keep the blood and the brain stirred\\nup and active; the scenery and the woodsy smells are good to bear in\\nupon a man an unconscious and unobtrusive charm and solace to eye and\\nsoul and sense; but the supreme pleasure comes from the talk. It is no\\nmatter whether one talks wisdom or nonsense, the case is the same, the\\nbulk of the enjoyment lies in the wagging of the gladsome jaw and the\\nflapping of the sympathetic ear.\\n\\nAnd what motley variety of subjects a couple of people will casually\\nrake over in the course of a day\\'s tramp! There being no constraint,\\na change of subject is always in order, and so a body is not likely to\\nkeep pegging at a single topic until it grows tiresome. We discussed\\neverything we knew, during the first fifteen or twenty minutes, that\\nmorning, and then branched out into the glad, free, boundless realm of\\nthe things we were not certain about.\\n\\nHarris said that if the best writer in the world once got the slovenly\\nhabit of doubling up his \"haves\" he could never get rid of it while he\\nlived. That is to say, if a man gets the habit of saying \"I should\\nhave liked to have known more about it\" instead of saying simply and\\nsensibly, \"I should have liked to know more about it,\" that man\\'s\\ndisease is incurable. Harris said that his sort of lapse is to be found\\nin every copy of every newspaper that has ever been printed in English,\\nand in almost all of our books. He said he had observed it in Kirkham\\'s\\ngrammar and in Macaulay. Harris believed that milk-teeth are commoner in\\nmen\\'s mouths than those \"doubled-up haves.\"\\n\\nI do not know that there have not been moments in the course of the\\npresent session when I should have been very glad to have accepted the\\nproposal of my noble friend, and to have exchanged parts in some of\\nour evenings of work.--[From a Speech of the English Chancellor of the\\nExchequer, August, 1879.]\\n\\nThat changed the subject to dentistry. I said I believed the average\\nman dreaded tooth-pulling more than amputation, and that he would yell\\nquicker under the former operation than he would under the latter. The\\nphilosopher Harris said that the average man would not yell in either\\ncase if he had an audience. Then he continued:\\n\\n\"When our brigade first went into camp on the Potomac, we used to be\\nbrought up standing, occasionally, by an ear-splitting howl of anguish.\\nThat meant that a soldier was getting a tooth pulled in a tent. But the\\nsurgeons soon changed that; they instituted open-air dentistry. There\\nnever was a howl afterward--that is, from the man who was having the\\ntooth pulled. At the daily dental hour there would always be about five\\nhundred soldiers gathered together in the neighborhood of that dental\\nchair waiting to see the performance--and help; and the moment the\\nsurgeon took a grip on the candidate\\'s tooth and began to lift, every\\none of those five hundred rascals would clap his hand to his jaw and\\nbegin to hop around on one leg and howl with all the lungs he had!\\nIt was enough to raise your hair to hear that variegated and enormous\\nunanimous caterwaul burst out!\\n\\n\"With so big and so derisive an audience as that, a sufferer wouldn\\'t\\nemit a sound though you pulled his head off. The surgeons said that\\npretty often a patient was compelled to laugh, in the midst of his\\npangs, but that they had never caught one crying out, after the open-air\\nexhibition was instituted.\"\\n\\nDental surgeons suggested doctors, doctors suggested death, death\\nsuggested skeletons--and so, by a logical process the conversation\\nmelted out of one of these subjects and into the next, until the topic\\nof skeletons raised up Nicodemus Dodge out of the deep grave in my\\nmemory where he had lain buried and forgotten for twenty-five years.\\nWhen I was a boy in a printing-office in Missouri, a loose-jointed,\\nlong-legged, tow-headed, jeans-clad countrified cub of about sixteen\\nlounged in one day, and without removing his hands from the depths of\\nhis trousers pockets or taking off his faded ruin of a slouch hat, whose\\nbroken rim hung limp and ragged about his eyes and ears like a bug-eaten\\ncabbage leaf, stared indifferently around, then leaned his hip against\\nthe editor\\'s table, crossed his mighty brogans, aimed at a distant\\nfly from a crevice in his upper teeth, laid him low, and said with\\ncomposure:\\n\\n\"Whar\\'s the boss?\"\\n\\n\"I am the boss,\" said the editor, following this curious bit of\\narchitecture wonderingly along up to its clock-face with his eye.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t want anybody fur to learn the business, \\'tain\\'t likely?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know. Would you like to learn it?\"\\n\\n\"Pap\\'s so po\\' he cain\\'t run me no mo\\', so I want to git a show somers if\\nI kin, \\'taint no diffunce what--I\\'m strong and hearty, and I don\\'t turn\\nmy back on no kind of work, hard nur soft.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think you would like to learn the printing business?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t re\\'ly k\\'yer a durn what I _do_ learn, so\\'s I git a chance\\nfur to make my way.

Oh, he\\'s a blacksmith.\"\\n\\n\"No, no--I don\\'t mean his trade. What\\'s his _religious denomination_?\"\\n\\n\"_Oh_--I didn\\'t understand you befo\\'. He\\'s a Freemason.\"\\n\\n\"No, no, you don\\'t get my meaning yet. What I mean is, does he belong to\\nany _church_?\"\\n\\n\"_Now_ you\\'re talkin\\'! Couldn\\'t make out what you was a-tryin\\' to git\\nthrough yo\\' head no way. B\\'long to a _church_! Why, boss, he\\'s ben the\\npizenest kind of Free-will Babtis\\' for forty year.

We\\'ll give you a trial, anyway.\"\\n\\n\"All right.\"\\n\\n\"When would you like to begin?\"\\n\\n\"Now.\"\\n\\nSo, within ten minutes after we had first glimpsed this nondescript he\\nwas one of us, and with his coat off and hard at it.\\n\\nBeyond that end of our establishment which was furthest from the street,\\nwas a deserted garden, pathless, and thickly grown with the bloomy and\\nvillainous \"jimpson\" weed and its common friend the stately sunflower.\\nIn the midst of this mournful spot was a decayed and aged little \"frame\"\\nhouse with but one room, one window, and no ceiling--it had been a\\nsmoke-house a generation before. Nicodemus was given this lonely and\\nghostly den as a bedchamber.\\n\\nThe village smarties recognized a treasure in Nicodemus, right away--a\\nbutt to play jokes on. It was easy to see that he was inconceivably\\ngreen and confiding. George Jones had the glory of perpetrating the\\nfirst joke on him; he gave him a cigar with a firecracker in it and\\nwinked to the crowd to come; the thing exploded presently and swept away\\nthe bulk of Nicodemus\\'s eyebrows and eyelashes. He simply said:\\n\\n\"I consider them kind of seeg\\'yars dangersome,\"--and seemed to suspect\\nnothing. The next evening Nicodemus waylaid George and poured a bucket\\nof ice-water over him.\\n\\nOne day, while Nicodemus was in swimming, Tom McElroy \"tied\" his\\nclothes. Nicodemus made a bonfire of Tom\\'s by way of retaliation.\\n\\nA third joke was played upon Nicodemus a day or two later--he walked\\nup the middle aisle of the village church, Sunday night, with a staring\\nhandbill pinned between his shoulders. The joker spent the remainder\\nof the night, after church, in the cellar of a deserted house, and\\nNicodemus sat on the cellar door till toward breakfast-time to make\\nsure that the prisoner remembered that if any noise was made, some rough\\ntreatment would be the consequence. The cellar had two feet of stagnant\\nwater in it, and was bottomed with six inches of soft mud.\\n\\nBut I wander from the point. It was the subject of skeletons that\\nbrought this boy back to my recollection. Before a very long time\\nhad elapsed, the village smarties began to feel an uncomfortable\\nconsciousness of not having made a very shining success out of their\\nattempts on the simpleton from \"old Shelby.\" Experimenters grew scarce\\nand chary. Now the young doctor came to the rescue. There was delight\\nand applause when he proposed to scare Nicodemus to death, and explained\\nhow he was going to do it. He had a noble new skeleton--the skeleton of\\nthe late and only local celebrity, Jimmy Finn, the village drunkard--a\\ngrisly piece of property which he had bought of Jimmy Finn himself, at\\nauction, for fifty dollars, under great competition, when Jimmy lay very\\nsick in the tan-yard a fortnight before his death. The fifty dollars had\\ngone promptly for whiskey and had considerably hurried up the change of\\nownership in the skeleton. The doctor would put Jimmy Finn\\'s skeleton in\\nNicodemus\\'s bed!\\n\\nThis was done--about half past ten in the evening. About Nicodemus\\'s\\nusual bedtime--midnight--the village jokers came creeping stealthily\\nthrough the jimpson weeds and sunflowers toward the lonely frame den.\\nThey reached the window and peeped in. There sat the long-legged pauper,\\non his bed, in a very short shirt, and nothing more; he was dangling\\nhis legs contentedly back and forth, and wheezing the music of \"Camptown\\nRaces\" out of a paper-overlaid comb which he was pressing against his\\nmouth; by him lay a new jewsharp, a new top, and solid india-rubber\\nball, a handful of painted marbles, five pounds of \"store\" candy, and\\na well-gnawed slab of gingerbread as big and as thick as a volume of\\nsheet-music. He had sold the skeleton to a traveling quack for three\\ndollars and was enjoying the result!\\n\\nJust as we had finished talking about skeletons and were drifting into\\nthe subject of fossils, Harris and I heard a shout, and glanced up the\\nsteep hillside. We saw men and women standing away up there looking\\nfrightened, and there was a bulky object tumbling and floundering down\\nthe steep slope toward us. We got out of the way, and when the object\\nlanded in the road it proved to be a boy. He had tripped and fallen, and\\nthere was nothing for him to do but trust to luck and take what might\\ncome.\\n\\nWhen one starts to roll down a place like that, there is no stopping\\ntill the bottom is reached. Think of people _farming_ on a slant\\nwhich is so steep that the best you can say of it--if you want to be\\nfastidiously accurate--is, that it is a little steeper than a ladder and\\nnot quite so steep as a mansard roof. But that is what they do. Some\\nof the little farms on the hillside opposite Heidelberg were stood\\nup \"edgeways.\" The boy was wonderfully jolted up, and his head was\\nbleeding, from cuts which it had got from small stones on the way.\\n\\nHarris and I gathered him up and set him on a stone, and by that time\\nthe men and women had scampered down and brought his cap.\\n\\nMen, women, and children flocked out from neighboring cottages\\nand joined the crowd; the pale boy was petted, and stared at, and\\ncommiserated, and water was brought for him to drink and bathe his\\nbruises in. And such another clatter of tongues! All who had seen the\\ncatastrophe were describing it at once, and each trying to talk louder\\nthan his neighbor; and one youth of a superior genius ran a little way\\nup the hill, called attention, tripped, fell, rolled down among us, and\\nthus triumphantly showed exactly how the thing had been done.\\n\\nHarris and I were included in all the descriptions; how we were coming\\nalong; how Hans Gross shouted; how we looked up startled; how we saw\\nPeter coming like a cannon-shot; how judiciously we got out of the way,\\nand let him come; and with what presence of mind we picked him up and\\nbrushed him off and set him on a rock when the performance was over.\\nWe were as much heroes as anybody else, except Peter, and were so\\nrecognized; we were taken with Peter and the populace to Peter\\'s\\nmother\\'s cottage, and there we ate bread and cheese, and drank milk and\\nbeer with everybody, and had a most sociable good time; and when we\\nleft we had a handshake all around, and were receiving and shouting back\\n_leb\\' wohl_\\'s until a turn in the road separated us from our cordial and\\nkindly new friends forever.\\n\\nWe accomplished our undertaking. At half past eight in the evening\\nwe stepped into Oppenau, just eleven hours and a half out of\\nAllerheiligen--one hundred and forty-six miles. This is the distance by\\npedometer; the guide-book and the Imperial Ordinance maps make it only\\nten and a quarter--a surprising blunder, for these two authorities are\\nusually singularly accurate in the matter of distances.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV\\n\\n[I Protect the Empress of Germany]\\n\\nThat was a thoroughly satisfactory walk--and the only one we were ever\\nto have which was all the way downhill. We took the train next morning\\nand returned to Baden-Baden through fearful fogs of dust. Every seat was\\ncrowded, too; for it was Sunday, and consequently everybody was taking\\na \"pleasure\" excursion. Hot! the sky was an oven--and a sound one,\\ntoo, with no cracks in it to let in any air. An odd time for a pleasure\\nexcursion, certainly!\\n\\nSunday is the great day on the continent--the free day, the happy day.\\nOne can break the Sabbath in a hundred ways without committing any sin.\\n\\nWe do not work on Sunday, because the commandment forbids it; the\\nGermans do not work on Sunday, because the commandment forbids it. We\\nrest on Sunday, because the commandment requires it; the Germans rest on\\nSunday because the commandment requires it. But in the definition of\\nthe word \"rest\" lies all the difference. With us, its Sunday meaning\\nis, stay in the house and keep still; with the Germans its Sunday and\\nweek-day meanings seem to be the same--rest the _tired part_, and never\\nmind the other parts of the frame; rest the tired part, and use the\\nmeans best calculated to rest that particular part. Thus: If one\\'s\\nduties have kept him in the house all the week, it will rest him to\\nbe out on Sunday; if his duties have required him to read weighty and\\nserious matter all the week, it will rest him to read light matter on\\nSunday; if his occupation has busied him with death and funerals all the\\nweek, it will rest him to go to the theater Sunday night and put in two\\nor three hours laughing at a comedy; if he is tired with digging ditches\\nor felling trees all the week, it will rest him to lie quiet in the\\nhouse on Sunday; if the hand, the arm, the brain, the tongue, or any\\nother member, is fatigued with inanition, it is not to be rested by\\naddeding a day\\'s inanition; but if a member is fatigued with exertion,\\ninanition is the right rest for it. Such is the way in which the Germans\\nseem to define the word \"rest\"; that is to say, they rest a member by\\nrecreating, recuperating, restoring its forces. But our definition is\\nless broad. We all rest alike on Sunday--by secluding ourselves and\\nkeeping still, whether that is the surest way to rest the most of us or\\nnot. The Germans make the actors, the preachers, etc., work on Sunday.\\nWe encourage the preachers, the editors, the printers, etc., to work on\\nSunday, and imagine that none of the sin of it falls upon us; but I do\\nnot know how we are going to get around the fact that if it is wrong for\\nthe printer to work at his trade on Sunday it must be equally wrong for\\nthe preacher to work at his, since the commandment has made no exception\\nin his favor. We buy Monday morning\\'s paper and read it, and thus\\nencourage Sunday printing. But I shall never do it again.\\n\\nThe Germans remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy, by abstaining\\nfrom work, as commanded; we keep it holy by abstaining from work, as\\ncommanded, and by also abstaining from play, which is not commanded.\\nPerhaps we constructively _break_ the command to rest, because the\\nresting we do is in most cases only a name, and not a fact.\\n\\nThese reasonings have sufficed, in a measure, to mend the rent in my\\nconscience which I made by traveling to Baden-Baden that Sunday. We\\narrived in time to furbish up and get to the English church before\\nservices began. We arrived in considerable style, too, for the landlord\\nhad ordered the first carriage that could be found, since there was no\\ntime to lose, and our coachman was so splendidly liveried that we were\\nprobably mistaken for a brace of stray dukes; why else were we honored\\nwith a pew all to ourselves, away up among the very elect at the left of\\nthe chancel? That was my first thought. In the pew directly in front of\\nus sat an elderly lady, plainly and cheaply dressed; at her side sat\\na young lady with a very sweet face, and she also was quite simply\\ndressed; but around us and about us were clothes and jewels which it\\nwould do anybody\\'s heart good to worship in.\\n\\nI thought it was pretty manifest that the elderly lady was embarrassed\\nat finding herself in such a conspicuous place arrayed in such cheap\\napparel; I began to feel sorry for her and troubled about her. She\\ntried to seem very busy with her prayer-book and her responses, and\\nunconscious that she was out of place, but I said to myself, \"She is\\nnot succeeding--there is a distressed tremulousness in her voice which\\nbetrays increasing embarrassment.\" Presently the Savior\\'s name was\\nmentioned, and in her flurry she lost her head completely, and rose and\\ncourtesied, instead of making a slight nod as everybody else did. The\\nsympathetic blood surged to my temples and I turned and gave those fine\\nbirds what I intended to be a beseeching look, but my feelings got the\\nbetter of me and changed it into a look which said, \"If any of you pets\\nof fortune laugh at this poor soul, you will deserve to be flayed for\\nit.\" Things went from bad to worse, and I shortly found myself mentally\\ntaking the unfriended lady under my protection. My mind was wholly upon\\nher. I forgot all about the sermon. Her embarrassment took stronger\\nand stronger hold upon her; she got to snapping the lid of her\\nsmelling-bottle--it made a loud, sharp sound, but in her trouble she\\nsnapped and snapped away, unconscious of what she was doing. The last\\nextremity was reached when the collection-plate began its rounds; the\\nmoderate people threw in pennies, the nobles and the rich contributed\\nsilver, but she laid a twenty-mark gold piece upon the book-rest before\\nher with a sounding slap! I said to myself, \"She has parted with all her\\nlittle hoard to buy the consideration of these unpitying people--it is a\\nsorrowful spectacle.\" I did not venture to look around this time; but\\nas the service closed, I said to myself, \"Let them laugh, it is their\\nopportunity; but at the door of this church they shall see her step into\\nour fine carriage with us, and our gaudy coachman shall drive her home.\"\\n\\nThen she rose--and all the congregation stood while she walked down the\\naisle. She was the Empress of Germany!\\n\\nNo--she had not been so much embarrassed as I had supposed. My\\nimagination had got started on the wrong scent, and that is always\\nhopeless; one is sure, then, to go straight on misinterpreting\\neverything, clear through to the end. The young lady with her imperial\\nMajesty was a maid of honor--and I had been taking her for one of her\\nboarders, all the time.\\n\\nThis is the only time I have ever had an Empress under my personal\\nprotection; and considering my inexperience, I wonder I got through\\nwith it so well. I should have been a little embarrassed myself if I had\\nknown earlier what sort of a contract I had on my hands.\\n\\nWe found that the Empress had been in Baden-Baden several days. It is\\nsaid that she never attends any but the English form of church service.\\n\\nI lay abed and read and rested from my journey\\'s fatigues the remainder\\nof that Sunday, but I sent my agent to represent me at the afternoon\\nservice, for I never allow anything to interfere with my habit of\\nattending church twice every Sunday.\\n\\nThere was a vast crowd in the public grounds that night to hear the band\\nplay the \"Fremersberg.\" This piece tells one of the old legends of the\\nregion; how a great noble of the Middle Ages got lost in the mountains,\\nand wandered about with his dogs in a violent storm, until at last\\nthe faint tones of a monastery bell, calling the monks to a midnight\\nservice, caught his ear, and he followed the direction the sounds came\\nfrom and was saved. A beautiful air ran through the music, without\\nceasing, sometimes loud and strong, sometimes so soft that it could\\nhardly be distinguished--but it was always there; it swung grandly along\\nthrough the shrill whistling of the storm-wind, the rattling patter of\\nthe rain, and the boom and crash of the thunder; it wound soft and low\\nthrough the lesser sounds, the distant ones, such as the throbbing\\nof the convent bell, the melodious winding of the hunter\\'s horn, the\\ndistressed bayings of his dogs, and the solemn chanting of the monks;\\nit rose again, with a jubilant ring, and mingled itself with the country\\nsongs and dances of the peasants assembled in the convent hall to\\ncheer up the rescued huntsman while he ate his supper. The instruments\\nimitated all these sounds with a marvelous exactness. More than one man\\nstarted to raise his umbrella when the storm burst forth and the sheets\\nof mimic rain came driving by; it was hardly possible to keep from\\nputting your hand to your hat when the fierce wind began to rage and\\nshriek; and it was _not_ possible to refrain from starting when those\\nsudden and charmingly real thunder-crashes were let loose.\\n\\nI suppose the \"Fremersberg\" is a very low-grade music; I know, indeed,\\nthat it _must_ be low-grade music, because it delighted me, warmed me,\\nmoved me, stirred me, uplifted me, enraptured me, that I was full of\\ncry all the time, and mad with enthusiasm. My soul had never had such a\\nscouring out since I was born. The solemn and majestic chanting of the\\nmonks was not done by instruments, but by men\\'s voices; and it rose\\nand fell, and rose again in that rich confusion of warring sounds, and\\npulsing bells, and the stately swing of that ever-present enchanting\\nair, and it seemed to me that nothing but the very lowest of low-grade\\nmusic _could_ be so divinely beautiful. The great crowd which the\\n\"Fremersberg\" had called out was another evidence that it was low-grade\\nmusic; for only the few are educated up to a point where high-grade\\nmusic gives pleasure. I have never heard enough classic music to be able\\nto enjoy it. I dislike the opera because I want to love it and can\\'t.\\n\\nI suppose there are two kinds of music--one kind which one feels, just\\nas an oyster might, and another sort which requires a higher faculty,\\na faculty which must be assisted and developed by teaching. Yet if base\\nmusic gives certain of us wings, why should we want any other? But we\\ndo. We want it because the higher and better like it. We want it without\\ngiving it the necessary time and trouble; so we climb into that upper\\ntier, that dress-circle, by a lie; we _pretend_ we like it. I know\\nseveral of that sort of people--and I propose to be one of them myself\\nwhen I get home with my fine European education.\\n\\nAnd then there is painting. What a red rag is to a bull, Turner\\'s \"Slave\\nShip\" was to me, before I studied art. Mr. Ruskin is educated in art\\nup to a point where that picture throws him into as mad an ecstasy of\\npleasure as it used to throw me into one of rage, last year, when I was\\nignorant. His cultivation enables him--and me, now--to see water in that\\nglaring yellow mud, and natural effects in those lurid explosions\\nof mixed smoke and flame, and crimson sunset glories; it reconciles\\nhim--and me, now--to the floating of iron cable-chains and other\\nunfloatable things; it reconciles us to fishes swimming around on top\\nof the mud--I mean the water. The most of the picture is a manifest\\nimpossibility--that is to say, a lie; and only rigid cultivation can\\nenable a man to find truth in a lie. But it enabled Mr. Ruskin to do\\nit, and it has enabled me to do it, and I am thankful for it. A Boston\\nnewspaper reporter went and took a look at the Slave Ship floundering\\nabout in that fierce conflagration of reds and yellows, and said it\\nreminded him of a tortoise-shell cat having a fit in a platter\\nof tomatoes. In my then uneducated state, that went home to my\\nnon-cultivation, and I thought here is a man with an unobstructed eye.\\nMr. Ruskin would have said: This person is an ass. That is what I would\\nsay, now.\\n\\nMonths after this was written, I happened into the National Gallery in\\nLondon, and soon became so fascinated with the Turner pictures that I\\ncould hardly get away from the place. I went there often, afterward,\\nmeaning to see the rest of the gallery, but the Turner spell was too\\nstrong; it could not be shaken off. However, the Turners which attracted\\nme most did not remind me of the Slave Ship.\\n\\nHowever, our business in Baden-Baden this time, was to join our courier.\\nI had thought it best to hire one, as we should be in Italy, by and by,\\nand we did not know the language. Neither did he. We found him at the\\nhotel, ready to take charge of us. I asked him if he was \"all fixed.\" He\\nsaid he was. That was very true. He had a trunk, two small satchels,\\nand an umbrella. I was to pay him fifty-five dollars a month and railway\\nfares. On the continent the railway fare on a trunk is about the same\\nit is on a man. Couriers do not have to pay any board and lodging. This\\nseems a great saving to the tourist--at first. It does not occur to the\\ntourist that _somebody_ pays that man\\'s board and lodging. It occurs to\\nhim by and by, however, in one of his lucid moments.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\n[Hunted by the Little Chamois]\\n\\nNext morning we left in the train for Switzerland, and reached Lucerne\\nabout ten o\\'clock at night. The first discovery I made was that the\\nbeauty of the lake had not been exaggerated. Within a day or two I made\\nanother discovery. This was, that the lauded chamois is not a wild goat;\\nthat it is not a horned animal; that it is not shy; that it does not\\navoid human society; and that there is no peril in hunting it.\\n\\nThe chamois is a black or brown creature no bigger than a mustard seed;\\nyou do not have to go after it, it comes after you; it arrives in vast\\nherds and skips and scampers all over your body, inside your clothes;\\nthus it is not shy, but extremely sociable; it is not afraid of man, on\\nthe contrary, it will attack him; its bite is not dangerous, but neither\\nis it pleasant; its activity has not been overstated--if you try to put\\nyour finger on it, it will skip a thousand times its own length at one\\njump, and no eye is sharp enough to see where it lights. A great deal\\nof romantic nonsense has been written about the Swiss chamois and the\\nperils of hunting it, whereas the truth is that even women and children\\nhunt it, and fearlessly; indeed, everybody hunts it; the hunting is\\ngoing on all the time, day and night, in bed and out of it. It is poetic\\nfoolishness to hunt it with a gun; very few people do that; there is\\nnot one man in a million who can hit it with a gun. It is much easier to\\ncatch it than it is to shoot it, and only the experienced chamois-hunter\\ncan do either. Another common piece of exaggeration is that about the\\n\"scarcity\" of the chamois. It is the reverse of scarce. Droves of one\\nhundred million chamois are not unusual in the Swiss hotels. Indeed,\\nthey are so numerous as to be a great pest. The romancers always dress\\nup the chamois-hunter in a fanciful and picturesque costume, whereas the\\nbest way to hunt this game is to do it without any costume at all.\\n\\nThe article of commerce called chamois-skin is another fraud; nobody\\ncould skin a chamois, it is too small. The creature is a humbug in\\nevery way, and everything which has been written about it is sentimental\\nexaggeration. It was no pleasure to me to find the chamois out, for he\\nhad been one of my pet illusions; all my life it had been my dream to\\nsee him in his native wilds some day, and engage in the adventurous\\nsport of chasing him from cliff to cliff. It is no pleasure to me to\\nexpose him, now, and destroy the reader\\'s delight in him and respect for\\nhim, but still it must be done, for when an honest writer discovers an\\nimposition it is his simple duty to strip it bare and hurl it down from\\nits place of honor, no matter who suffers by it; any other course would\\nrender him unworthy of the public confidence.\\n\\nLucerne is a charming place. It begins at the water\\'s edge, with a\\nfringe of hotels, and scrambles up and spreads itself over two or three\\nsharp hills in a crowded, disorderly, but picturesque way, offering\\nto the eye a heaped-up confusion of red roofs, quaint gables, dormer\\nwindows, toothpick steeples, with here and there a bit of ancient\\nembattled wall bending itself over the ridges, worm-fashion, and here\\nand there an old square tower of heavy masonry. And also here and there\\na town clock with only one hand--a hand which stretches across the dial\\nand has no joint in it; such a clock helps out the picture, but you\\ncannot tell the time of day by it. Between the curving line of hotels\\nand the lake is a broad avenue with lamps and a double rank of low shade\\ntrees. The lake-front is walled with masonry like a pier, and has\\na railing, to keep people from walking overboard. All day long the\\nvehicles dash along the avenue, and nurses, children, and tourists sit\\nin the shade of the trees, or lean on the railing and watch the schools\\nof fishes darting about in the clear water, or gaze out over the lake\\nat the stately border of snow-hooded mountain peaks. Little pleasure\\nsteamers, black with people, are coming and going all the time; and\\neverywhere one sees young girls and young men paddling about in fanciful\\nrowboats, or skimming along by the help of sails when there is any wind.\\nThe front rooms of the hotels have little railed balconies, where one\\nmay take his private luncheon in calm, cool comfort and look down upon\\nthis busy and pretty scene and enjoy it without having to do any of the\\nwork connected with it.\\n\\nMost of the people, both male and female, are in walking costume, and\\ncarry alpenstocks. Evidently, it is not considered safe to go about in\\nSwitzerland, even in town, without an alpenstock. If the tourist forgets\\nand comes down to breakfast without his alpenstock he goes back and gets\\nit, and stands it up in the corner. When his touring in Switzerland is\\nfinished, he does not throw that broomstick away, but lugs it home\\nwith him, to the far corners of the earth, although this costs him\\nmore trouble and bother than a baby or a courier could. You see, the\\nalpenstock is his trophy; his name is burned upon it; and if he has\\nclimbed a hill, or jumped a brook, or traversed a brickyard with it, he\\nhas the names of those places burned upon it, too.\\n\\nThus it is his regimental flag, so to speak, and bears the record of his\\nachievements. It is worth three francs when he buys it, but a bonanza\\ncould not purchase it after his great deeds have been inscribed upon it.\\nThere are artisans all about Switzerland whose trade it is to burn\\nthese things upon the alpenstock of the tourist. And observe, a man is\\nrespected in Switzerland according to his alpenstock. I found I could\\nget no attention there, while I carried an unbranded one. However,\\nbranding is not expected, so I soon remedied that. The effect upon\\nthe next detachment of tourists was very marked. I felt repaid for my\\ntrouble.\\n\\nHalf of the summer horde in Switzerland is made up of English people;\\nthe other half is made up of many nationalities, the Germans leading and\\nthe Americans coming next. The Americans were not as numerous as I had\\nexpected they would be.\\n\\nThe seven-thirty table d\\'hte at the great Schweitzerhof furnished\\na mighty array and variety of nationalities, but it offered a better\\nopportunity to observe costumes than people, for the multitude sat\\nat immensely long tables, and therefore the faces were mainly seen in\\nperspective; but the breakfasts were served at small round tables,\\nand then if one had the fortune to get a table in the midst of the\\nassemblage he could have as many faces to study as he could desire.\\nWe used to try to guess out the nationalities, and generally succeeded\\ntolerably well. Sometimes we tried to guess people\\'s names; but that\\nwas a failure; that is a thing which probably requires a good deal of\\npractice. We presently dropped it and gave our efforts to less difficult\\nparticulars. One morning I said:\\n\\n\"There is an American party.\"\\n\\nHarris said:\\n\\n\"Yes--but name the state.\"\\n\\nI named one state, Harris named another. We agreed upon one thing,\\nhowever--that the young girl with the party was very beautiful, and\\nvery tastefully dressed. But we disagreed as to her age. I said she was\\neighteen, Harris said she was twenty. The dispute between us waxed warm,\\nand I finally said, with a pretense of being in earnest:\\n\\n\"Well, there is one way to settle the matter--I will go and ask her.\"\\n\\nHarris said, sarcastically, \"Certainly, that is the thing to do. All you\\nneed to do is to use the common formula over here: go and say, \\'I\\'m an\\nAmerican!\\' Of course she will be glad to see you.\"\\n\\nThen he hinted that perhaps there was no great danger of my venturing to\\nspeak to her.\\n\\nI said, \"I was only talking--I didn\\'t intend to approach her, but I see\\nthat you do not know what an intrepid person I am. I am not afraid of\\nany woman that walks. I will go and speak to this young girl.\"\\n\\nThe thing I had in my mind was not difficult. I meant to address her\\nin the most respectful way and ask her to pardon me if her strong\\nresemblance to a former acquaintance of mine was deceiving me; and when\\nshe should reply that the name I mentioned was not the name she bore, I\\nmeant to beg pardon again, most respectfully, and retire. There would be\\nno harm done. I walked to her table, bowed to the gentleman, then turned\\nto her and was about to begin my little speech when she exclaimed:\\n\\n\"I _knew_ I wasn\\'t mistaken--I told John it was you! John said it\\nprobably wasn\\'t, but I knew I was right. I said you would recognize me\\npresently and come over; and I\\'m glad you did, for I shouldn\\'t have felt\\nmuch flattered if you had gone out of this room without recognizing me.\\nSit down, sit down--how odd it is--you are the last person I was ever\\nexpecting to see again.\"\\n\\nThis was a stupefying surprise. It took my wits clear away, for an\\ninstant. However, we shook hands cordially all around, and I sat down.\\nBut truly this was the tightest place I ever was in. I seemed to vaguely\\nremember the girl\\'s face, now, but I had no idea where I had seen it\\nbefore, or what name belonged with it. I immediately tried to get up a\\ndiversion about Swiss scenery, to keep her from launching into topics\\nthat might betray that I did not know her, but it was of no use, she\\nwent right along upon matters which interested her more:\\n\\n\"Oh dear, what a night that was, when the sea washed the forward boats\\naway--do you remember it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, _don\\'t I_!\" said I--but I didn\\'t. I wished the sea had washed\\nthe rudder and the smoke-stack and the captain away--then I could have\\nlocated this questioner.\\n\\n\"And don\\'t you remember how frightened poor Mary was, and how she\\ncried?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed I do!\" said I. \"Dear me, how it all comes back!\"\\n\\nI fervently wished it _would_ come back--but my memory was a blank. The\\nwise way would have been to frankly own up; but I could not bring myself\\nto do that, after the young girl had praised me so for recognizing her;\\nso I went on, deeper and deeper into the mire, hoping for a chance clue\\nbut never getting one. The Unrecognizable continued, with vivacity:\\n\\n\"Do you know, George married Mary, after all?\"\\n\\n\"Why, no! Did he?\"\\n\\n\"Indeed he did. He said he did not believe she was half as much to blame\\nas her father was, and I thought he was right. Didn\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Of course he was. It was a perfectly plain case. I always said so.\"\\n\\n\"Why, no you didn\\'t!--at least that summer.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, no, not that summer. No, you are perfectly right about that. It was\\nthe following winter that I said it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, as it turned out, Mary was not in the least to blame--it was all\\nher father\\'s fault--at least his and old Darley\\'s.\"\\n\\nIt was necessary to say something--so I said:\\n\\n\"I always regarded Darley as a troublesome old thing.\"\\n\\n\"So he was, but then they always had a great affection for him, although\\nhe had so many eccentricities. You remember that when the weather was\\nthe least cold, he would try to come into the house.\"\\n\\nI was rather afraid to proceed. Evidently Darley was not a man--he\\nmust be some other kind of animal--possibly a dog, maybe an elephant.\\nHowever, tails are common to all animals, so I ventured to say:\\n\\n\"And what a tail he had!\"\\n\\n\"_One_! He had a thousand!\"\\n\\nThis was bewildering. I did not quite know what to say, so I only said:\\n\\n\"Yes, he _was_ rather well fixed in the matter of tails.\"\\n\\n\"For a negro, and a crazy one at that, I should say he was,\" said she.\\n\\nIt was getting pretty sultry for me. I said to myself, \"Is it possible\\nshe is going to stop there, and wait for me to speak? If she does, the\\nconversation is blocked. A negro with a thousand tails is a topic which\\na person cannot talk upon fluently and instructively without more or\\nless preparation. As to diving rashly into such a vast subject--\"\\n\\nBut here, to my gratitude, she interrupted my thoughts by saying:\\n\\n\"Yes, when it came to tales of his crazy woes, there was simply no\\nend to them if anybody would listen. His own quarters were comfortable\\nenough, but when the weather was cold, the family were sure to have his\\ncompany--nothing could keep him out of the house. But they always bore\\nit kindly because he had saved Tom\\'s life, years before. You remember\\nTom?\\n\\n\"Oh, perfectly. Fine fellow he was, too.\"\\n\\n\"Yes he was. And what a pretty little thing his child was!\"\\n\\n\"You may well say that. I never saw a prettier child.\"\\n\\n\"I used to delight to pet it and dandle it and play with it.\"\\n\\n\"So did I.\"\\n\\n\"You named it. What _was_ that name? I can\\'t call it to mind.\"\\n\\nIt appeared to me that the ice was getting pretty thin, here. I would\\nhave given something to know what the child\\'s was. However, I had the\\ngood luck to think of a name that would fit either sex--so I brought it\\nout:\\n\\n\"I named it Frances.\"\\n\\n\"From a relative, I suppose? But you named the one that died, too--one\\nthat I never saw. What did you call that one?\"\\n\\nI was out of neutral names, but as the child was dead and she had\\nnever seen it, I thought I might risk a name for it and trust to luck.\\nTherefore I said:\\n\\n\"I called that one Thomas Henry.\"\\n\\nShe said, musingly:\\n\\n\"That is very singular ... very singular.\"\\n\\nI sat still and let the cold sweat run down. I was in a good deal of\\ntrouble, but I believed I could worry through if she wouldn\\'t ask me\\nto name any more children. I wondered where the lightning was going to\\nstrike next. She was still ruminating over that last child\\'s title, but\\npresently she said:\\n\\n\"I have always been sorry you were away at the time--I would have had\\nyou name my child.\"\\n\\n\"_Your_ child! Are you married?\"\\n\\n\"I have been married thirteen years.\"\\n\\n\"Christened, you mean.\"\\n\\n`\"No, married. The youth by your side is my son.\"\\n\\n\"It seems incredible--even impossible. I do not mean any harm by it, but\\nwould you mind telling me if you are any over eighteen?--that is to say,\\nwill you tell me how old you are?\"\\n\\n\"I was just nineteen the day of the storm we were talking about. That\\nwas my birthday.\"\\n\\nThat did not help matters, much, as I did not know the date of the\\nstorm. I tried to think of some non-committal thing to say, to keep up\\nmy end of the talk, and render my poverty in the matter of reminiscences\\nas little noticeable as possible, but I seemed to be about out of\\nnon-committal things. I was about to say, \"You haven\\'t changed a bit\\nsince then\"--but that was risky. I thought of saying, \"You have improved\\never so much since then\"--but that wouldn\\'t answer, of course. I was\\nabout to try a shy at the weather, for a saving change, when the girl\\nslipped in ahead of me and said:\\n\\n\"How I have enjoyed this talk over those happy old times--haven\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"I never have spent such a half-hour in all my life before!\" said I,\\nwith emotion; and I could have added, with a near approach to truth,\\n\"and I would rather be scalped than spend another one like it.\" I was\\nholily grateful to be through with the ordeal, and was about to make my\\ngood-bys and get out, when the girl said:\\n\\n\"But there is one thing that is ever so puzzling to me.\"\\n\\n\"Why, what is that?\"\\n\\n\"That dead child\\'s name. What did you say it was?\"\\n\\nHere was another balmy place to be in: I had forgotten the child\\'s name;\\nI hadn\\'t imagined it would be needed again. However, I had to pretend to\\nknow, anyway, so I said:\\n\\n\"Joseph William.\"\\n\\nThe youth at my side corrected me, and said:\\n\\n\"No, Thomas Henry.\"\\n\\nI thanked him--in words--and said, with trepidation:\\n\\n\"O yes--I was thinking of another child that I named--I have named\\na great many, and I get them confused--this one was named Henry\\nThompson--\"\\n\\n\"Thomas Henry,\" calmly interposed the boy.\\n\\nI thanked him again--strictly in words--and stammered out:\\n\\n\"Thomas Henry--yes, Thomas Henry was the poor child\\'s name. I named\\nhim for Thomas--er--Thomas Carlyle, the great author, you know--and\\nHenry--er--er--Henry the Eighth. The parents were very grateful to have\\na child named Thomas Henry.\"\\n\\n\"That makes it more singular than ever,\" murmured my beautiful friend.\\n\\n\"Does it? Why?\"\\n\\n\"Because when the parents speak of that child now, they always call it\\nSusan Amelia.\"\\n\\nThat spiked my gun. I could not say anything. I was entirely out of\\nverbal obliquities; to go further would be to lie, and that I would not\\ndo; so I simply sat still and suffered--sat mutely and resignedly there,\\nand sizzled--for I was being slowly fried to death in my own blushes.\\nPresently the enemy laughed a happy laugh and said:\\n\\n\"I _have_ enjoyed this talk over old times, but you have not. I saw very\\nsoon that you were only pretending to know me, and so as I had wasted a\\ncompliment on you in the beginning, I made up my mind to punish you. And\\nI have succeeded pretty well. I was glad to see that you knew George and\\nTom and Darley, for I had never heard of them before and therefore could\\nnot be sure that you had; and I was glad to learn the names of those\\nimaginary children, too. One can get quite a fund of information out\\nof you if one goes at it cleverly. Mary and the storm, and the sweeping\\naway of the forward boats, were facts--all the rest was fiction. Mary\\nwas my sister; her full name was Mary ------. _Now_ do you remember me?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"I do remember you now; and you are as hard-headed as you\\nwere thirteen years ago in that ship, else you wouldn\\'t have punished me\\nso. You haven\\'t changed your nature nor your person, in any way at all;\\nyou look as young as you did then, you are just as beautiful as you were\\nthen, and you have transmitted a deal of your comeliness to this fine\\nboy. There--if that speech moves you any, let\\'s fly the flag of truce,\\nwith the understanding that I am conquered and confess it.\"\\n\\nAll of which was agreed to and accomplished, on the spot. When I went\\nback to Harris, I said:\\n\\n\"Now you see what a person with talent and address can do.\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me, I see what a person of colossal ignorance and simplicity can\\ndo. The idea of your going and intruding on a party of strangers, that\\nway, and talking for half an hour; why I never heard of a man in his\\nright mind doing such a thing before. What did you say to them?\"\\n\\n\"I never said any harm. I merely asked the girl what her name was.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t doubt it. Upon my word I don\\'t. I think you were capable of it.\\nIt was stupid in me to let you go over there and make such an exhibition\\nof yourself. But you know I couldn\\'t really believe you would do such an\\ninexcusable thing. What will those people think of us? But how did you\\nsay it?--I mean the manner of it. I hope you were not abrupt.\"\\n\\n\"No, I was careful about that. I said, \\'My friend and I would like to\\nknow what your name is, if you don\\'t mind.\\'\"\\n\\n\"No, that was not abrupt. There is a polish about it that does you\\ninfinite credit. And I am glad you put me in; that was a delicate\\nattention which I appreciate at its full value. What did she do?\"\\n\\n\"She didn\\'t do anything in particular. She told me her name.\"\\n\\n\"Simply told you her name. Do you mean to say she did not show any\\nsurprise?\"\\n\\n\"Well, now I come to think, she did show something; maybe it was\\nsurprise; I hadn\\'t thought of that--I took it for gratification.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, undoubtedly you were right; it must have been gratification; it\\ncould not be otherwise than gratifying to be assaulted by a stranger\\nwith such a question as that. Then what did you do?\"\\n\\n\"I offered my hand and the party gave me a shake.\"\\n\\n\"I saw it! I did not believe my own eyes, at the time. Did the gentleman\\nsay anything about cutting your throat?\"\\n\\n\"No, they all seemed glad to see me, as far as I could judge.\"\\n\\n\"And do you know, I believe they were. I think they said to themselves,\\n\\'Doubtless this curiosity has got away from his keeper--let us amuse\\nourselves with him.\\' There is no other way of accounting for their\\nfacile docility. You sat down. Did they _ask_ you to sit down?\"\\n\\n\"No, they did not ask me, but I suppose they did not think of it.\"\\n\\n\"You have an unerring instinct. What else did you do? What did you talk\\nabout?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I asked the girl how old she was.\"\\n\\n\"_Un_doubtedly. Your delicacy is beyond praise. Go on, go on--don\\'t mind\\nmy apparent misery--I always look so when I am steeped in a profound and\\nreverent joy. Go on--she told you her age?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, she told me her age, and all about her mother, and her\\ngrandmother, and her other relations, and all about herself.\"\\n\\n\"Did she volunteer these statistics?\"\\n\\n\"No, not exactly that. I asked the questions and she answered them.\"\\n\\n\"This is divine. Go on--it is not possible that you forgot to inquire\\ninto her politics?\"\\n\\n\"No, I thought of that. She is a democrat, her husband is a republican,\\nand both of them are Baptists.\"\\n\\n\"Her husband? Is that child married?\"\\n\\n\"She is not a child. She is married, and that is her husband who is\\nthere with her.\"\\n\\n\"Has she any children.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--seven and a half.\"\\n\\n\"That is impossible.\"\\n\\n\"No, she has them. She told me herself.\"\\n\\n\"Well, but seven and a _half_? How do you make out the half? Where does\\nthe half come in?\"\\n\\n\"There is a child which she had by another husband--not this one\\nbut another one--so it is a stepchild, and they do not count in full\\nmeasure.\"\\n\\n\"Another husband? Has she another husband?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, four. This one is number four.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe a word of it. It is impossible, upon its face. Is that\\nboy there her brother?\"\\n\\n\"No, that is her son. He is her youngest. He is not as old as he looked;\\nhe is only eleven and a half.\"\\n\\n\"These things are all manifestly impossible. This is a wretched\\nbusiness. It is a plain case: they simply took your measure, and\\nconcluded to fill you up. They seem to have succeeded. I am glad I am\\nnot in the mess; they may at least be charitable enough to think there\\nain\\'t a pair of us. Are they going to stay here long?\"\\n\\n\"No, they leave before noon.\"\\n\\n\"There is one man who is deeply grateful for that. How did you find out?\\nYou asked, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"No, along at first I inquired into their plans, in a general way, and\\nthey said they were going to be here a week, and make trips round about;\\nbut toward the end of the interview, when I said you and I would tour\\naround with them with pleasure, and offered to bring you over and\\nintroduce you, they hesitated a little, and asked if you were from the\\nsame establishment that I was. I said you were, and then they said they\\nhad changed their mind and considered it necessary to start at once and\\nvisit a sick relative in Siberia.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, me, you struck the summit! You struck the loftiest altitude of\\nstupidity that human effort has ever reached. You shall have a monument\\nof jackasses\\' skulls as high as the Strasburg spire if you die before\\nI do. They wanted to know I was from the same \\'establishment\\' that you\\nhailed from, did they? What did they mean by \\'establishment\\'?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know; it never occurred to me to ask.\"\\n\\n\"Well _I_ know. They meant an asylum--an _idiot_ asylum, do you\\nunderstand? So they _do_ think there\\'s a pair of us, after all. Now what\\ndo you think of yourself?\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t know. I didn\\'t know I was doing any harm; I didn\\'t _mean_\\nto do any harm. They were very nice people, and they seemed to like me.\"\\n\\nHarris made some rude remarks and left for his bedroom--to break some\\nfurniture, he said. He was a singularly irascible man; any little thing\\nwould disturb his temper.\\n\\nI had been well scorched by the young woman, but no matter, I took it\\nout on Harris. One should always \"get even\" in some way, else the sore\\nplace will go on hurting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVI\\n\\n[The Nest of the Cuckoo-clock]\\n\\nThe Hofkirche is celebrated for its organ concerts. All summer long the\\ntourists flock to that church about six o\\'clock in the evening, and pay\\ntheir franc, and listen to the noise. They don\\'t stay to hear all of\\nit, but get up and tramp out over the sounding stone floor, meeting late\\ncomers who tramp in in a sounding and vigorous way. This tramping\\nback and forth is kept up nearly all the time, and is accented by\\nthe continuous slamming of the door, and the coughing and barking and\\nsneezing of the crowd. Meantime, the big organ is booming and crashing\\nand thundering away, doing its best to prove that it is the biggest and\\nbest organ in Europe, and that a tight little box of a church is the\\nmost favorable place to average and appreciate its powers in. It is\\ntrue, there were some soft and merciful passages occasionally, but the\\ntramp-tramp of the tourists only allowed one to get fitful glimpses of\\nthem, so to speak. Then right away the organist would let go another\\navalanche.\\n\\nThe commerce of Lucerne consists mainly in gimcrackery of the souvenir\\nsort; the shops are packed with Alpine crystals, photographs of\\nscenery, and wooden and ivory carvings. I will not conceal the fact that\\nminiature figures of the Lion of Lucerne are to be had in them. Millions\\nof them. But they are libels upon him, every one of them. There is a\\nsubtle something about the majestic pathos of the original which the\\ncopyist cannot get. Even the sun fails to get it; both the photographer\\nand the carver give you a dying lion, and that is all. The shape is\\nright, the attitude is right, the proportions are right, but that\\nindescribable something which makes the Lion of Lucerne the most\\nmournful and moving piece of stone in the world, is wanting.\\n\\nThe Lion lies in his lair in the perpendicular face of a low cliff--for\\nhe is carved from the living rock of the cliff. His size is colossal,\\nhis attitude is noble. His head is bowed, the broken spear is sticking\\nin his shoulder, his protecting paw rests upon the lilies of France.\\nVines hang down the cliff and wave in the wind, and a clear stream\\ntrickles from above and empties into a pond at the base, and in the\\nsmooth surface of the pond the lion is mirrored, among the water-lilies.\\n\\nAround about are green trees and grass. The place is a sheltered,\\nreposeful woodland nook, remote from noise and stir and confusion--and\\nall this is fitting, for lions do die in such places, and not on granite\\npedestals in public squares fenced with fancy iron railings. The Lion of\\nLucerne would be impressive anywhere, but nowhere so impressive as where\\nhe is.\\n\\nMartyrdom is the luckiest fate that can befall some people. Louis XVI\\ndid not die in his bed, consequently history is very gentle with him;\\nshe is charitable toward his failings, and she finds in him high virtues\\nwhich are not usually considered to be virtues when they are lodged in\\nkings. She makes him out to be a person with a meek and modest spirit,\\nthe heart of a female saint, and a wrong head. None of these qualities\\nare kingly but the last. Taken together they make a character which\\nwould have fared harshly at the hands of history if its owner had had\\nthe ill luck to miss martyrdom. With the best intentions to do the right\\nthing, he always managed to do the wrong one. Moreover, nothing could\\nget the female saint out of him. He knew, well enough, that in national\\nemergencies he must not consider how he ought to act, as a man, but how\\nhe ought to act as a king; so he honestly tried to sink the man and be\\nthe king--but it was a failure, he only succeeded in being the female\\nsaint. He was not instant in season, but out of season. He could not be\\npersuaded to do a thing while it could do any good--he was iron, he was\\nadamant in his stubbornness then--but as soon as the thing had reached a\\npoint where it would be positively harmful to do it, do it he would, and\\nnothing could stop him. He did not do it because it would be harmful,\\nbut because he hoped it was not yet too late to achieve by it the good\\nwhich it would have done if applied earlier. His comprehension was\\nalways a train or two behindhand. If a national toe required amputating,\\nhe could not see that it needed anything more than poulticing; when\\nothers saw that the mortification had reached the knee, he first\\nperceived that the toe needed cutting off--so he cut it off; and he\\nsevered the leg at the knee when others saw that the disease had reached\\nthe thigh. He was good, and honest, and well meaning, in the matter of\\nchasing national diseases, but he never could overtake one. As a private\\nman, he would have been lovable; but viewed as a king, he was strictly\\ncontemptible.\\n\\nHis was a most unroyal career, but the most pitiable spectacle in it was\\nhis sentimental treachery to his Swiss guard on that memorable 10th of\\nAugust, when he allowed those heroes to be massacred in his cause, and\\nforbade them to shed the \"sacred French blood\" purporting to be flowing\\nin the veins of the red-capped mob of miscreants that was raging around\\nthe palace. He meant to be kingly, but he was only the female saint once\\nmore. Some of his biographers think that upon this occasion the spirit\\nof Saint Louis had descended upon him. It must have found pretty cramped\\nquarters. If Napoleon the First had stood in the shoes of Louis XVI that\\nday, instead of being merely a casual and unknown looker-on, there would\\nbe no Lion of Lucerne, now, but there would be a well-stocked Communist\\ngraveyard in Paris which would answer just as well to remember the 10th\\nof August by.\\n\\nMartyrdom made a saint of Mary Queen of Scots three hundred years ago,\\nand she has hardly lost all of her saintship yet. Martyrdom made a saint\\nof the trivial and foolish Marie Antoinette, and her biographers\\nstill keep her fragrant with the odor of sanctity to this day, while\\nunconsciously proving upon almost every page they write that the only\\ncalamitous instinct which her husband lacked, she supplied--the instinct\\nto root out and get rid of an honest, able, and loyal official, wherever\\nshe found him. The hideous but beneficent French Revolution would have\\nbeen deferred, or would have fallen short of completeness, or even\\nmight not have happened at all, if Marie Antoinette had made the unwise\\nmistake of not being born. The world owes a great deal to the French\\nRevolution, and consequently to its two chief promoters, Louis the Poor\\nin Spirit and his queen.\\n\\nWe did not buy any wooden images of the Lion, nor any ivory or ebony\\nor marble or chalk or sugar or chocolate ones, or even any photographic\\nslanders of him. The truth is, these copies were so common, so\\nuniversal, in the shops and everywhere, that they presently became as\\nintolerable to the wearied eye as the latest popular melody usually\\nbecomes to the harassed ear. In Lucerne, too, the wood carvings of\\nother sorts, which had been so pleasant to look upon when one saw them\\noccasionally at home, soon began to fatigue us. We grew very tired\\nof seeing wooden quails and chickens picking and strutting around\\nclock-faces, and still more tired of seeing wooden images of the alleged\\nchamois skipping about wooden rocks, or lying upon them in family\\ngroups, or peering alertly up from behind them. The first day, I would\\nhave bought a hundred and fifty of these clocks if I had the money--and\\nI did buy three--but on the third day the disease had run its course,\\nI had convalesced, and was in the market once more--trying to sell.\\nHowever, I had no luck; which was just as well, for the things will be\\npretty enough, no doubt, when I get them home.\\n\\nFor years my pet aversion had been the cuckoo clock; now here I was, at\\nlast, right in the creature\\'s home; so wherever I went that distressing\\n\"HOO\\'hoo! HOO\\'hoo! HOO\\'hoo!\" was always in my ears. For a nervous man,\\nthis was a fine state of things. Some sounds are hatefuler than others,\\nbut no sound is quite so inane, and silly, and aggravating as the\\n\"HOO\\'hoo\" of a cuckoo clock, I think. I bought one, and am carrying it\\nhome to a certain person; for I have always said that if the opportunity\\never happened, I would do that man an ill turn.\\n\\nWhat I meant, was, that I would break one of his legs, or something of\\nthat sort; but in Lucerne I instantly saw that I could impair his mind.\\nThat would be more lasting, and more satisfactory every way. So I bought\\nthe cuckoo clock; and if I ever get home with it, he is \"my meat,\" as\\nthey say in the mines. I thought of another candidate--a book-reviewer\\nwhom I could name if I wanted to--but after thinking it over, I didn\\'t\\nbuy him a clock. I couldn\\'t injure his mind.\\n\\nWe visited the two long, covered wooden bridges which span the green and\\nbrilliant Reuss just below where it goes plunging and hurrahing out\\nof the lake. These rambling, sway-backed tunnels are very attractive\\nthings, with their alcoved outlooks upon the lovely and inspiriting\\nwater. They contain two or three hundred queer old pictures, by old\\nSwiss masters--old boss sign-painters, who flourished before the\\ndecadence of art.\\n\\nThe lake is alive with fishes, plainly visible to the eye, for the water\\nis very clear. The parapets in front of the hotels were usually fringed\\nwith fishers of all ages. One day I thought I would stop and see a\\nfish caught. The result brought back to my mind, very forcibly, a\\ncircumstance which I had not thought of before for twelve years. This\\none:\\n\\nTHE MAN WHO PUT UP AT GADSBY\\'S\\n\\nWhen my odd friend Riley and I were newspaper correspondents in\\nWashington, in the winter of \\'67, we were coming down Pennsylvania\\nAvenue one night, near midnight, in a driving storm of snow, when the\\nflash of a street-lamp fell upon a man who was eagerly tearing along in\\nthe opposite direction. \"This is lucky! You are Mr. Riley, ain\\'t you?\"\\n\\nRiley was the most self-possessed and solemnly deliberate person in the\\nrepublic. He stopped, looked his man over from head to foot, and finally\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"I am Mr. Riley. Did you happen to be looking for me?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s just what I was doing,\" said the man, joyously, \"and it\\'s the\\nbiggest luck in the world that I\\'ve found you. My name is Lykins. I\\'m\\none of the teachers of the high school--San Francisco. As soon as I\\nheard the San Francisco postmastership was vacant, I made up my mind to\\nget it--and here I am.\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said Riley, slowly, \"as you have remarked ... Mr. Lykins ... here\\nyou are. And have you got it?\"\\n\\n\"Well, not exactly _got_ it, but the next thing to it. I\\'ve brought a\\npetition, signed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and all\\nthe teachers, and by more than two hundred other people. Now I want you,\\nif you\\'ll be so good, to go around with me to the Pacific delegation,\\nfor I want to rush this thing through and get along home.\"\\n\\n\"If the matter is so pressing, you will prefer that we visit the\\ndelegation tonight,\" said Riley, in a voice which had nothing mocking in\\nit--to an unaccustomed ear.\\n\\n\"Oh, tonight, by all means! I haven\\'t got any time to fool around. I\\nwant their promise before I go to bed--I ain\\'t the talking kind, I\\'m the\\n_doing_ kind!\"\\n\\n\"Yes ... you\\'ve come to the right place for that. When did you arrive?\"\\n\\n\"Just an hour ago.\"\\n\\n\"When are you intending to leave?\"\\n\\n\"For New York tomorrow evening--for San Francisco next morning.\"\\n\\n\"Just so.... What are you going to do tomorrow?\"\\n\\n\"_Do_! Why, I\\'ve got to go to the President with the petition and the\\ndelegation, and get the appointment, haven\\'t I?\"\\n\\n\"Yes ... very true ... that is correct. And then what?\"\\n\\n\"Executive session of the Senate at 2 P.M.--got to get the appointment\\nconfirmed--I reckon you\\'ll grant that?\"\\n\\n\"Yes ... yes,\" said Riley, meditatively, \"you are right again. Then\\nyou take the train for New York in the evening, and the steamer for San\\nFrancisco next morning?\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s it--that\\'s the way I map it out!\"\\n\\nRiley considered a while, and then said:\\n\\n\"You couldn\\'t stay ... a day ... well, say two days longer?\"\\n\\n\"Bless your soul, no! It\\'s not my style. I ain\\'t a man to go fooling\\naround--I\\'m a man that _does_ things, I tell you.\"\\n\\nThe storm was raging, the thick snow blowing in gusts. Riley stood\\nsilent, apparently deep in a reverie, during a minute or more, then he\\nlooked up and said:\\n\\n\"Have you ever heard about that man who put up at Gadsby\\'s, once? ...\\nBut I see you haven\\'t.\"\\n\\nHe backed Mr. Lykins against an iron fence, buttonholed him, fastened\\nhim with his eye, like the Ancient Mariner, and proceeded to unfold\\nhis narrative as placidly and peacefully as if we were all stretched\\ncomfortably in a blossomy summer meadow instead of being persecuted by a\\nwintry midnight tempest:\\n\\n\"I will tell you about that man. It was in Jackson\\'s time. Gadsby\\'s was\\nthe principal hotel, then. Well, this man arrived from Tennessee\\nabout nine o\\'clock, one morning, with a black coachman and a splendid\\nfour-horse carriage and an elegant dog, which he was evidently fond\\nof and proud of; he drove up before Gadsby\\'s, and the clerk and the\\nlandlord and everybody rushed out to take charge of him, but he said,\\n\\'Never mind,\\' and jumped out and told the coachman to wait--said\\nhe hadn\\'t time to take anything to eat, he only had a little claim\\nagainst the government to collect, would run across the way, to\\nthe Treasury, and fetch the money, and then get right along back to\\nTennessee, for he was in considerable of a hurry.\\n\\n\"Well, about eleven o\\'clock that night he came back and ordered a bed\\nand told them to put the horses up--said he would collect the claim in\\nthe morning. This was in January, you understand--January, 1834--the 3d\\nof January--Wednesday.\\n\\n\"Well, on the 5th of February, he sold the fine carriage, and bought\\na cheap second-hand one--said it would answer just as well to take the\\nmoney home in, and he didn\\'t care for style.\\n\\n\"On the 11th of August he sold a pair of the fine horses--said he\\'d\\noften thought a pair was better than four, to go over the rough mountain\\nroads with where a body had to be careful about his driving--and there\\nwasn\\'t so much of his claim but he could lug the money home with a pair\\neasy enough.\\n\\n\"On the 13th of December he sold another horse--said two warn\\'t\\nnecessary to drag that old light vehicle with--in fact, one could snatch\\nit along faster than was absolutely necessary, now that it was good\\nsolid winter weather and the roads in splendid condition.\\n\\n\"On the 17th of February, 1835, he sold the old carriage and bought a\\ncheap second-hand buggy--said a buggy was just the trick to skim along\\nmushy, slushy early spring roads with, and he had always wanted to try a\\nbuggy on those mountain roads, anyway.\\n\\n\"On the 1st August he sold the buggy and bought the remains of an old\\nsulky--said he just wanted to see those green Tennesseans stare and gawk\\nwhen they saw him come a-ripping along in a sulky--didn\\'t believe they\\'d\\never heard of a sulky in their lives.\\n\\n\"Well, on the 29th of August he sold his colored coachman--said he\\ndidn\\'t need a coachman for a sulky--wouldn\\'t be room enough for two in\\nit anyway--and, besides, it wasn\\'t every day that Providence sent a man\\na fool who was willing to pay nine hundred dollars for such a third-rate\\nnegro as that--been wanting to get rid of the creature for years, but\\ndidn\\'t like to _throw_ him away.\\n\\n\"Eighteen months later--that is to say, on the 15th of February,\\n1837--he sold the sulky and bought a saddle--said horseback-riding was\\nwhat the doctor had always recommended _him_ to take, and dog\\'d if he\\nwanted to risk _his_ neck going over those mountain roads on wheels in\\nthe dead of winter, not if he knew himself.\\n\\n\"On the 9th of April he sold the saddle--said he wasn\\'t going to risk\\n_his_ life with any perishable saddle-girth that ever was made, over a\\nrainy, miry April road, while he could ride bareback and know and feel\\nhe was safe--always _had_ despised to ride on a saddle, anyway.\\n\\n\"On the 24th of April he sold his horse--said \\'I\\'m just fifty-seven\\ntoday, hale and hearty--it would be a _pretty_ howdy-do for me to be\\nwasting such a trip as that and such weather as this, on a horse, when\\nthere ain\\'t anything in the world so splendid as a tramp on foot through\\nthe fresh spring woods and over the cheery mountains, to a man that _is_\\na man--and I can make my dog carry my claim in a little bundle, anyway,\\nwhen it\\'s collected. So tomorrow I\\'ll be up bright and early, make my\\nlittle old collection, and mosey off to Tennessee, on my own hind legs,\\nwith a rousing good-by to Gadsby\\'s.\\'\\n\\n\"On the 22d of June he sold his dog--said \\'Dern a dog, anyway, where\\nyou\\'re just starting off on a rattling bully pleasure tramp through the\\nsummer woods and hills--perfect nuisance--chases the squirrels, barks\\nat everything, goes a-capering and splattering around in the fords--man\\ncan\\'t get any chance to reflect and enjoy nature--and I\\'d a blamed sight\\nruther carry the claim myself, it\\'s a mighty sight safer; a dog\\'s\\nmighty uncertain in a financial way--always noticed it--well, _good_-by,\\nboys--last call--I\\'m off for Tennessee with a good leg and a gay heart,\\nearly in the morning.\\'\"\\n\\nThere was a pause and a silence--except the noise of the wind and the\\npelting snow. Mr. Lykins said, impatiently:\\n\\n\"Well?\"\\n\\nRiley said:\\n\\n\"Well,--that was thirty years ago.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, very well--what of it?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m great friends with that old patriarch. He comes every evening to\\ntell me good-by. I saw him an hour ago--he\\'s off for Tennessee early\\ntomorrow morning--as usual; said he calculated to get his claim through\\nand be off before night-owls like me have turned out of bed. The tears\\nwere in his eyes, he was so glad he was going to see his old Tennessee\\nand his friends once more.\"\\n\\nAnother silent pause. The stranger broke it:\\n\\n\"Is that all?\"\\n\\n\"That is all.\"\\n\\n\"Well, for the _time_ of night, and the _kind_ of night, it seems to me\\nthe story was full long enough. But what\\'s it all _for_?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, nothing in particular.\"\\n\\n\"Well, where\\'s the point of it?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, there isn\\'t any particular point to it. Only, if you are not in\\n_too_ much of a hurry to rush off to San Francisco with that post-office\\nappointment, Mr. Lykins, I\\'d advise you to \\'_Put Up At Gadsby\\'s_\\' for a\\nspell, and take it easy. Good-by. _God_ bless you!\"\\n\\nSo saying, Riley blandly turned on his heel and left the astonished\\nschool-teacher standing there, a musing and motionless snow image\\nshining in the broad glow of the street-lamp.\\n\\nHe never got that post-office.\\n\\nTo go back to Lucerne and its fishers, I concluded, after about\\nnine hours\\' waiting, that the man who proposes to tarry till he sees\\nsomething hook one of those well-fed and experienced fishes will find\\nit wisdom to \"put up at Gadsby\\'s\" and take it easy. It is likely that\\na fish has not been caught on that lake pier for forty years; but no\\nmatter, the patient fisher watches his cork there all the day long, just\\nthe same, and seems to enjoy it. One may see the fisher-loafers just as\\nthick and contented and happy and patient all along the Seine at Paris,\\nbut tradition says that the only thing ever caught there in modern times\\nis a thing they don\\'t fish for at all--the recent dog and the translated\\ncat.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVII\\n\\n[I Spare an Awful Bore]\\n\\nClose by the Lion of Lucerne is what they call the \"Glacier Garden\"--and\\nit is the only one in the world. It is on high ground. Four or five\\nyears ago, some workmen who were digging foundations for a house came\\nupon this interesting relic of a long-departed age. Scientific men\\nperceived in it a confirmation of their theories concerning the glacial\\nperiod; so through their persuasions the little tract of ground was\\nbought and permanently protected against being built upon. The soil was\\nremoved, and there lay the rasped and guttered track which the ancient\\nglacier had made as it moved along upon its slow and tedious journey.\\nThis track was perforated by huge pot-shaped holes in the bed-rock,\\nformed by the furious washing-around in them of boulders by the\\nturbulent torrent which flows beneath all glaciers. These huge round\\nboulders still remain in the holes; they and the walls of the holes are\\nworn smooth by the long-continued chafing which they gave each other in\\nthose old days.\\n\\nIt took a mighty force to churn these big lumps of stone around in that\\nvigorous way. The neighboring country had a very different shape, at\\nthat time--the valleys have risen up and become hills, since, and the\\nhills have become valleys. The boulders discovered in the pots had\\ntraveled a great distance, for there is no rock like them nearer than\\nthe distant Rhone Glacier.\\n\\nFor some days we were content to enjoy looking at the blue lake\\nLucerne and at the piled-up masses of snow-mountains that border it all\\naround--an enticing spectacle, this last, for there is a strange and\\nfascinating beauty and charm about a majestic snow-peak with the sun\\nblazing upon it or the moonlight softly enriching it--but finally we\\nconcluded to try a bit of excursioning around on a steamboat, and a dash\\non foot at the Rigi. Very well, we had a delightful trip to Fluelen, on\\na breezy, sunny day. Everybody sat on the upper deck, on benches, under\\nan awning; everybody talked, laughed, and exclaimed at the wonderful\\nscenery; in truth, a trip on that lake is almost the perfection of\\npleasuring.\\n\\nThe mountains were a never-ceasing marvel. Sometimes they rose straight\\nup out of the lake, and towered aloft and overshadowed our pygmy steamer\\nwith their prodigious bulk in the most impressive way. Not snow-clad\\nmountains, these, yet they climbed high enough toward the sky to meet\\nthe clouds and veil their foreheads in them. They were not barren and\\nrepulsive, but clothed in green, and restful and pleasant to the eye.\\nAnd they were so almost straight-up-and-down, sometimes, that one could\\nnot imagine a man being able to keep his footing upon such a surface,\\nyet there are paths, and the Swiss people go up and down them every day.\\n\\nSometimes one of these monster precipices had the slight inclination of\\nthe huge ship-houses in dockyards--then high aloft, toward the sky, it\\ntook a little stronger inclination, like that of a mansard roof--and\\nperched on this dizzy mansard one\\'s eye detected little things like\\nmartin boxes, and presently perceived that these were the dwellings of\\npeasants--an airy place for a home, truly. And suppose a peasant should\\nwalk in his sleep, or his child should fall out of the front\\nyard?--the friends would have a tedious long journey down out of those\\ncloud-heights before they found the remains. And yet those far-away\\nhomes looked ever so seductive, they were so remote from the troubled\\nworld, they dozed in such an atmosphere of peace and dreams--surely no\\none who has learned to live up there would ever want to live on a meaner\\nlevel.\\n\\nWe swept through the prettiest little curving arms of the lake, among\\nthese colossal green walls, enjoying new delights, always, as the\\nstately panorama unfolded itself before us and rerolled and hid itself\\nbehind us; and now and then we had the thrilling surprise of bursting\\nsuddenly upon a tremendous white mass like the distant and dominating\\nJungfrau, or some kindred giant, looming head and shoulders above a\\ntumbled waste of lesser Alps.\\n\\nOnce, while I was hungrily taking in one of these surprises, and doing\\nmy best to get all I possibly could of it while it should last, I was\\ninterrupted by a young and care-free voice:\\n\\n\"You\\'re an American, I think--so\\'m I.\"\\n\\nHe was about eighteen, or possibly nineteen; slender and of medium\\nheight; open, frank, happy face; a restless but independent eye; a snub\\nnose, which had the air of drawing back with a decent reserve from\\nthe silky new-born mustache below it until it should be introduced; a\\nloosely hung jaw, calculated to work easily in the sockets. He wore a\\nlow-crowned, narrow-brimmed straw hat, with a broad blue ribbon\\naround it which had a white anchor embroidered on it in front; nobby\\nshort-tailed coat, pantaloons, vest, all trim and neat and up with the\\nfashion; red-striped stockings, very low-quarter patent-leather shoes,\\ntied with black ribbon; blue ribbon around his neck, wide-open collar;\\ntiny diamond studs; wrinkleless kids; projecting cuffs, fastened with\\nlarge oxidized silver sleeve-buttons, bearing the device of a dog\\'s\\nface--English pug. He carried a slim cane, surmounted with an English\\npug\\'s head with red glass eyes. Under his arm he carried a German\\ngrammar--Otto\\'s. His hair was short, straight, and smooth, and presently\\nwhen he turned his head a moment, I saw that it was nicely parted\\nbehind. He took a cigarette out of a dainty box, stuck it into a\\nmeerschaum holder which he carried in a morocco case, and reached for my\\ncigar. While he was lighting, I said:\\n\\n\"Yes--I am an American.\"\\n\\n\"I knew it--I can always tell them. What ship did you come over in?\"\\n\\n\"_Holsatia_.\"\\n\\n\"We came in the _Batavia_--Cunard, you know. What kind of passage did\\nyou have?\"\\n\\n\"Tolerably rough.\"\\n\\n\"So did we. Captain said he\\'d hardly ever seen it rougher. Where are you\\nfrom?\"\\n\\n\"New England.\"\\n\\n\"So\\'m I. I\\'m from New Bloomfield. Anybody with you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--a friend.\"\\n\\n\"Our whole family\\'s along. It\\'s awful slow, going around alone--don\\'t\\nyou think so?\"\\n\\n\"Rather slow.\"\\n\\n\"Ever been over here before?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t. My first trip. But we\\'ve been all around--Paris and\\neverywhere. I\\'m to enter Harvard next year. Studying German all the\\ntime, now. Can\\'t enter till I know German. I know considerable French--I\\nget along pretty well in Paris, or anywhere where they speak French.\\nWhat hotel are you stopping at?\"\\n\\n\"Schweitzerhof.\"\\n\\n\"No! is that so? I never see you in the reception-room. I go to\\nthe reception-room a good deal of the time, because there\\'s so many\\nAmericans there. I make lots of acquaintances. I know an American as\\nsoon as I see him--and so I speak to him and make his acquaintance. I\\nlike to be always making acquaintances--don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Lord, yes!\"\\n\\n\"You see it breaks up a trip like this, first rate. I never got bored on\\na trip like this, if I can make acquaintances and have somebody to\\ntalk to. But I think a trip like this would be an awful bore, if a body\\ncouldn\\'t find anybody to get acquainted with and talk to on a trip like\\nthis. I\\'m fond of talking, ain\\'t you?\\n\\n\"Passionately.\"\\n\\n\"Have you felt bored, on this trip?\"\\n\\n\"Not all the time, part of it.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s it!--you see you ought to go around and get acquainted, and\\ntalk. That\\'s my way. That\\'s the way I always do--I just go \\'round,\\n\\'round, \\'round and talk, talk, talk--I never get bored. You been up the\\nRigi yet?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Going?\"\\n\\n\"I think so.\"\\n\\n\"What hotel you going to stop at?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. Is there more than one?\"\\n\\n\"Three. You stop at the Schreiber--you\\'ll find it full of Americans.\\nWhat ship did you say you came over in?\"\\n\\n\"_City of Antwerp_.\"\\n\\n\"German, I guess. You going to Geneva?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"What hotel you going to stop at?\"\\n\\n\"Htel de l\\'Ecu de Gnve.\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you do it! No Americans there! You stop at one of those big\\nhotels over the bridge--they\\'re packed full of Americans.\"\\n\\n\"But I want to practice my Arabic.\"\\n\\n\"Good gracious, do you speak Arabic?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--well enough to get along.\"\\n\\n\"Why, hang it, you won\\'t get along in Geneva--_they_ don\\'t speak Arabic,\\nthey speak French. What hotel are you stopping at here?\"\\n\\n\"Hotel Pension-Beaurivage.\"\\n\\n\"Sho, you ought to stop at the Schweitzerhof. Didn\\'t you know the\\nSchweitzerhof was the best hotel in Switzerland?--look at your\\nBaedeker.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I know--but I had an idea there warn\\'t any Americans there.\"\\n\\n\"No Americans! Why, bless your soul, it\\'s just alive with them! I\\'m in\\nthe great reception-room most all the time. I make lots of acquaintances\\nthere. Not as many as I did at first, because now only the new ones stop\\nin there--the others go right along through. Where are you from?\"\\n\\n\"Arkansaw.\"\\n\\n\"Is that so? I\\'m from New England--New Bloomfield\\'s my town when I\\'m at\\nhome. I\\'m having a mighty good time today, ain\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Divine.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s what I call it. I like this knocking around, loose and easy, and\\nmaking acquaintances and talking. I know an American, soon as I see him;\\nso I go and speak to him and make his acquaintance. I ain\\'t ever bored,\\non a trip like this, if I can make new acquaintances and talk. I\\'m awful\\nfond of talking when I can get hold of the right kind of a person, ain\\'t\\nyou?\"\\n\\n\"I prefer it to any other dissipation.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s my notion, too. Now some people like to take a book and sit\\ndown and read, and read, and read, or moon around yawping at the lake or\\nthese mountains and things, but that ain\\'t my way; no, sir, if they like\\nit, let \\'em do it, I don\\'t object; but as for me, talking\\'s what _I_\\nlike. You been up the Rigi?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"What hotel did you stop at?\"\\n\\n\"Schreiber.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s the place!--I stopped there too, _full_ of Americans, _wasn\\'t_\\nit? It always is--always is. That\\'s what they say. Everybody says that.\\nWhat ship did you come over in?\"\\n\\n\"_Ville De Paris_.\"\\n\\n\"French, I reckon. What kind of a passage did ... excuse me a minute,\\nthere\\'s some Americans I haven\\'t seen before.\"\\n\\nAnd away he went. He went uninjured, too--I had the murderous impulse to\\nharpoon him in the back with my alpenstock, but as I raised the weapon\\nthe disposition left me; I found I hadn\\'t the heart to kill him, he was\\nsuch a joyous, innocent, good-natured numbskull.\\n\\nHalf an hour later I was sitting on a bench inspecting, with strong\\ninterest, a noble monolith which we were skimming by--a monolith not\\nshaped by man, but by Nature\\'s free great hand--a massy pyramidal rock\\neighty feet high, devised by Nature ten million years ago against the\\nday when a man worthy of it should need it for his monument. The time\\ncame at last, and now this grand remembrancer bears Schiller\\'s name in\\nhuge letters upon its face. Curiously enough, this rock was not degraded\\nor defiled in any way. It is said that two years ago a stranger let\\nhimself down from the top of it with ropes and pulleys, and painted all\\nover it, in blue letters bigger than those in Schiller\\'s name, these\\nwords:\\n\\n\"Try Sozodont;\" \"Buy Sun Stove Polish;\" \"Helmbold\\'s Buchu;\" \"Try\\nBenzaline for the Blood.\"\\n\\nHe was captured and it turned out that he was an American. Upon his\\ntrial the judge said to him:\\n\\n\"You are from a land where any insolent that wants to is privileged\\nto profane and insult Nature, and, through her, Nature\\'s God, if by\\nso doing he can put a sordid penny in his pocket. But here the case is\\ndifferent. Because you are a foreigner and ignorant, I will make your\\nsentence light; if you were a native I would deal strenuously with\\nyou. Hear and obey:--You will immediately remove every trace of\\nyour offensive work from the Schiller monument; you pay a fine of ten\\nthousand francs; you will suffer two years\\' imprisonment at hard labor;\\nyou will then be horsewhipped, tarred and feathered, deprived of your\\nears, ridden on a rail to the confines of the canton, and banished\\nforever. The severest penalties are omitted in your case--not as a grace\\nto you, but to that great republic which had the misfortune to give you\\nbirth.\"\\n\\nThe steamer\\'s benches were ranged back to back across the deck. My back\\nhair was mingling innocently with the back hair of a couple of\\nladies. Presently they were addressed by some one and I overheard this\\nconversation:\\n\\n\"You are Americans, I think? So\\'m I.\"\\n\\n\"Yes--we are Americans.\"\\n\\n\"I knew it--I can always tell them. What ship did you come over in?\"\\n\\n\"_City of Chester_.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes--Inman line. We came in the _Batavia_--Cunard you know. What\\nkind of a passage did you have?\"\\n\\n\"Pretty fair.\"\\n\\n\"That was luck. We had it awful rough. Captain said he\\'d hardly seen it\\nrougher. Where are you from?\"\\n\\n\"New Jersey.\"\\n\\n\"So\\'m I. No--I didn\\'t mean that; I\\'m from New England. New Bloomfield\\'s\\nmy place. These your children?--belong to both of you?\"\\n\\n\"Only to one of us; they are mine; my friend is not married.\"\\n\\n\"Single, I reckon? So\\'m I. Are you two ladies traveling alone?\"\\n\\n\"No--my husband is with us.\"\\n\\n\"Our whole family\\'s along. It\\'s awful slow, going around alone--don\\'t\\nyou think so?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose it must be.\"\\n\\n\"Hi, there\\'s Mount Pilatus coming in sight again. Named after Pontius\\nPilate, you know, that shot the apple off of William Tell\\'s head.\\nGuide-book tells all about it, they say. I didn\\'t read it--an American\\ntold me. I don\\'t read when I\\'m knocking around like this, having a good\\ntime. Did you ever see the chapel where William Tell used to preach?\"\\n\\n\"I did not know he ever preached there.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, he did. That American told me so. He don\\'t ever shut up\\nhis guide-book. He knows more about this lake than the fishes in it.\\nBesides, they _call_ it \\'Tell\\'s Chapel\\'--you know that yourself. You\\never been over here before?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t. It\\'s my first trip. But we\\'ve been all around--Paris and\\neverywhere. I\\'m to enter Harvard next year. Studying German all the time\\nnow. Can\\'t enter till I know German. This book\\'s Otto\\'s grammar. It\\'s\\na mighty good book to get the _ich habe gehabt haben_\\'s out of. But\\nI don\\'t really study when I\\'m knocking around this way. If the notion\\ntakes me, I just run over my little old _ich habe gehabt, du hast\\ngehabt, er hat gehabt, wir haben gehabt, ihr haben gehabt, sie haben\\ngehabt_--kind of \\'Now-I-lay-me-down-to-sleep\\' fashion, you know, and\\nafter that, maybe I don\\'t buckle to it for three days. It\\'s awful\\nundermining to the intellect, German is; you want to take it in small\\ndoses, or first you know your brains all run together, and you feel them\\nsloshing around in your head same as so much drawn butter. But French\\nis different; _French_ ain\\'t anything. I ain\\'t any more afraid of French\\nthan a tramp\\'s afraid of pie; I can rattle off my little _j\\'ai, tu as,\\nil a_, and the rest of it, just as easy as a-b-c. I get along pretty\\nwell in Paris, or anywhere where they speak French. What hotel are you\\nstopping at?\"\\n\\n\"The Schweitzerhof.\"\\n\\n\"No! is that so? I never see you in the big reception-room. I go in\\nthere a good deal of the time, because there\\'s so many Americans there.\\nI make lots of acquaintances. You been up the Rigi yet?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"Going?\"\\n\\n\"We think of it.\"\\n\\n\"What hotel you going to stop at?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know.\"\\n\\n\"Well, then you stop at the Schreiber--it\\'s full of Americans. What ship\\ndid you come over in?\"\\n\\n\"_City of Chester_.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I remember I asked you that before. But I always ask everybody\\nwhat ship they came over in, and so sometimes I forget and ask again.\\nYou going to Geneva?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"What hotel you going to stop at?\"\\n\\n\"We expect to stop in a pension.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t hardly believe you\\'ll like that; there\\'s very few Americans in\\nthe pensions. What hotel are you stopping at here?\"\\n\\n\"The Schweitzerhof.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes. I asked you that before, too. But I always ask everybody what\\nhotel they\\'re stopping at, and so I\\'ve got my head all mixed up with\\nhotels. But it makes talk, and I love to talk. It refreshes me up\\nso--don\\'t it you--on a trip like this?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--sometimes.\"\\n\\n\"Well, it does me, too. As long as I\\'m talking I never feel bored--ain\\'t\\nthat the way with you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes--generally. But there are exception to the rule.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, of course. _I_ don\\'t care to talk to everybody, _myself_. If a\\nperson starts in to jabber-jabber-jabber about scenery, and history, and\\npictures, and all sorts of tiresome things, I get the fan-tods mighty\\nsoon. I say \\'Well, I must be going now--hope I\\'ll see you again\\'--and\\nthen I take a walk. Where you from?\"\\n\\n\"New Jersey.\"\\n\\n\"Why, bother it all, I asked you _that_ before, too. Have you seen the\\nLion of Lucerne?\"\\n\\n\"Not yet.\"\\n\\n\"Nor I, either. But the man who told me about Mount Pilatus says it\\'s\\none of the things to see. It\\'s twenty-eight feet long. It don\\'t seem\\nreasonable, but he said so, anyway. He saw it yesterday; said it was\\ndying, then, so I reckon it\\'s dead by this time. But that ain\\'t any\\nmatter, of course they\\'ll stuff it. Did you say the children are\\nyours--or _hers_?\"\\n\\n\"Mine.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, so you did. Are you going up the ... no, I asked you that. What\\nship ... no, I asked you that, too. What hotel are you ... no, you told\\nme that. Let me see ... um .... Oh, what kind of voy ... no, we\\'ve\\nbeen over that ground, too. Um ... um ... well, I believe that is all.\\n_bonjour_--I am very glad to have made your acquaintance, ladies, _guten\\ntag_.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXVIII\\n\\n[The Jodel and Its Native Wilds]\\n\\nThe Rigi-Kulm is an imposing Alpine mass, six thousand feet high, which\\nstands by itself, and commands a mighty prospect of blue lakes, green\\nvalleys, and snowy mountains--a compact and magnificent picture\\nthree hundred miles in circumference. The ascent is made by rail, or\\nhorseback, or on foot, as one may prefer. I and my agent panoplied\\nourselves in walking-costume, one bright morning, and started down\\nthe lake on the steamboat; we got ashore at the village of Waeggis;\\nthree-quarters of an hour distant from Lucerne. This village is at the\\nfoot of the mountain.\\n\\nWe were soon tramping leisurely up the leafy mule-path, and then the\\ntalk began to flow, as usual. It was twelve o\\'clock noon, and a breezy,\\ncloudless day; the ascent was gradual, and the glimpses, from under\\nthe curtaining boughs, of blue water, and tiny sailboats, and beetling\\ncliffs, were as charming as glimpses of dreamland. All the circumstances\\nwere perfect--and the anticipations, too, for we should soon be\\nenjoying, for the first time, that wonderful spectacle, an Alpine\\nsunrise--the object of our journey. There was (apparently) no real need\\nfor hurry, for the guide-book made the walking-distance from Waeggis to\\nthe summit only three hours and a quarter. I say \"apparently,\" because\\nthe guide-book had already fooled us once--about the distance from\\nAllerheiligen to Oppenau--and for aught I knew it might be getting\\nready to fool us again. We were only certain as to the altitudes--we\\ncalculated to find out for ourselves how many hours it is from the\\nbottom to the top. The summit is six thousand feet above the sea, but\\nonly forty-five hundred feet above the lake. When we had walked half an\\nhour, we were fairly into the swing and humor of the undertaking, so we\\ncleared for action; that is to say, we got a boy whom we met to carry\\nour alpenstocks and satchels and overcoats and things for us; that left\\nus free for business. I suppose we must have stopped oftener to stretch\\nout on the grass in the shade and take a bit of a smoke than this boy\\nwas used to, for presently he asked if it had been our idea to hire him\\nby the job, or by the year? We told him he could move along if he was\\nin a hurry. He said he wasn\\'t in such a very particular hurry, but he\\nwanted to get to the top while he was young.\\n\\nWe told him to clear out, then, and leave the things at the uppermost\\nhotel and say we should be along presently. He said he would secure us a\\nhotel if he could, but if they were all full he would ask them to build\\nanother one and hurry up and get the paint and plaster dry against we\\narrived. Still gently chaffing us, he pushed ahead, up the trail, and\\nsoon disappeared. By six o\\'clock we were pretty high up in the air,\\nand the view of lake and mountains had greatly grown in breadth and\\ninterest. We halted awhile at a little public house, where we had bread\\nand cheese and a quart or two of fresh milk, out on the porch, with the\\nbig panorama all before us--and then moved on again.\\n\\nTen minutes afterward we met a hot, red-faced man plunging down the\\nmountain, making mighty strides, swinging his alpenstock ahead of him,\\nand taking a grip on the ground with its iron point to support these\\nbig strides. He stopped, fanned himself with his hat, swabbed the\\nperspiration from his face and neck with a red handkerchief, panted\\na moment or two, and asked how far to Waeggis. I said three hours. He\\nlooked surprised, and said:\\n\\n\"Why, it seems as if I could toss a biscuit into the lake from here,\\nit\\'s so close by. Is that an inn, there?\"\\n\\nI said it was.\\n\\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I can\\'t stand another three hours, I\\'ve had enough\\ntoday; I\\'ll take a bed there.\"\\n\\nI asked:\\n\\n\"Are we nearly to the top?\"\\n\\n\"Nearly to the _top_? Why, bless your soul, you haven\\'t really started,\\nyet.\"\\n\\nI said we would put up at the inn, too. So we turned back and ordered a\\nhot supper, and had quite a jolly evening of it with this Englishman.\\n\\nThe German landlady gave us neat rooms and nice beds, and when I and my\\nagent turned in, it was with the resolution to be up early and make the\\nutmost of our first Alpine sunrise. But of course we were dead tired,\\nand slept like policemen; so when we awoke in the morning and ran to the\\nwindow it was already too late, because it was half past eleven. It\\nwas a sharp disappointment. However, we ordered breakfast and told the\\nlandlady to call the Englishman, but she said he was already up and off\\nat daybreak--and swearing like mad about something or other. We could\\nnot find out what the matter was. He had asked the landlady the altitude\\nof her place above the level of the lake, and she told him fourteen\\nhundred and ninety-five feet. That was all that was said; then he lost\\nhis temper. He said that between ------fools and guide-books, a man\\ncould acquire ignorance enough in twenty-four hours in a country like\\nthis to last him a year. Harris believed our boy had been loading him\\nup with misinformation; and this was probably the case, for his epithet\\ndescribed that boy to a dot.\\n\\nWe got under way about the turn of noon, and pulled out for the summit\\nagain, with a fresh and vigorous step. When we had gone about two\\nhundred yards, and stopped to rest, I glanced to the left while I was\\nlighting my pipe, and in the distance detected a long worm of black\\nsmoke crawling lazily up the steep mountain. Of course that was the\\nlocomotive. We propped ourselves on our elbows at once, to gaze, for we\\nhad never seen a mountain railway yet. Presently we could make out the\\ntrain. It seemed incredible that that thing should creep straight up a\\nsharp slant like the roof of a house--but there it was, and it was doing\\nthat very miracle.\\n\\nIn the course of a couple hours we reached a fine breezy altitude where\\nthe little shepherd huts had big stones all over their roofs to hold\\nthem down to the earth when the great storms rage. The country was wild\\nand rocky about here, but there were plenty of trees, plenty of moss,\\nand grass.\\n\\nAway off on the opposite shore of the lake we could see some villages,\\nand now for the first time we could observe the real difference between\\ntheir proportions and those of the giant mountains at whose feet they\\nslept. When one is in one of those villages it seems spacious, and\\nits houses seem high and not out of proportion to the mountain that\\noverhangs them--but from our altitude, what a change! The mountains were\\nbigger and grander than ever, as they stood there thinking their solemn\\nthoughts with their heads in the drifting clouds, but the villages\\nat their feet--when the painstaking eye could trace them up and find\\nthem--were so reduced, almost invisible, and lay so flat against the\\nground, that the exactest simile I can devise is to compare them to\\nant-deposits of granulated dirt overshadowed by the huge bulk of a\\ncathedral. The steamboats skimming along under the stupendous precipices\\nwere diminished by distance to the daintiest little toys, the sailboats\\nand rowboats to shallops proper for fairies that keep house in the cups\\nof lilies and ride to court on the backs of bumblebees.\\n\\nPresently we came upon half a dozen sheep nibbling grass in the spray\\nof a stream of clear water that sprang from a rock wall a hundred feet\\nhigh, and all at once our ears were startled with a melodious \"Lul ...\\nl ... l l l llul-lul-LAhee-o-o-o!\" pealing joyously from a near but\\ninvisible source, and recognized that we were hearing for the first time\\nthe famous Alpine _Jodel_ in its own native wilds. And we recognized,\\nalso, that it was that sort of quaint commingling of baritone and\\nfalsetto which at home we call \"Tyrolese warbling.\"\\n\\nThe jodeling (pronounced yOdling--emphasis on the O) continued, and\\nwas very pleasant and inspiriting to hear. Now the jodeler appeared--a\\nshepherd boy of sixteen--and in our gladness and gratitude we gave him\\na franc to jodel some more. So he jodeled and we listened. We moved\\non, presently, and he generously jodeled us out of sight. After about\\nfifteen minutes we came across another shepherd boy who was jodeling,\\nand gave him half a franc to keep it up. He also jodeled us out of\\nsight. After that, we found a jodeler every ten minutes; we gave the\\nfirst one eight cents, the second one six cents, the third one four, the\\nfourth one a penny, contributed nothing to Nos. 5, 6, and 7, and during\\nthe remainder of the day hired the rest of the jodelers, at a franc\\napiece, not to jodel any more. There is somewhat too much of the\\njodeling in the Alps.\\n\\nAbout the middle of the afternoon we passed through a prodigious natural\\ngateway called the Felsenthor, formed by two enormous upright rocks,\\nwith a third lying across the top. There was a very attractive little\\nhotel close by, but our energies were not conquered yet, so we went on.\\n\\nThree hours afterward we came to the railway-track. It was planted\\nstraight up the mountain with the slant of a ladder that leans against a\\nhouse, and it seemed to us that man would need good nerves who proposed\\nto travel up it or down it either.\\n\\nDuring the latter part of the afternoon we cooled our roasting interiors\\nwith ice-cold water from clear streams, the only really satisfying water\\nwe had tasted since we left home, for at the hotels on the continent\\nthey merely give you a tumbler of ice to soak your water in, and that\\nonly modifies its hotness, doesn\\'t make it cold. Water can only be made\\ncold enough for summer comfort by being prepared in a refrigerator or\\na closed ice-pitcher. Europeans say ice-water impairs digestion. How do\\nthey know?--they never drink any.\\n\\nAt ten minutes past six we reached the Kaltbad station, where there is\\na spacious hotel with great verandas which command a majestic expanse of\\nlake and mountain scenery. We were pretty well fagged out, now, but as\\nwe did not wish to miss the Alpine sunrise, we got through our dinner\\nas quickly as possible and hurried off to bed. It was unspeakably\\ncomfortable to stretch our weary limbs between the cool, damp sheets.\\nAnd how we did sleep!--for there is no opiate like Alpine pedestrianism.\\n\\nIn the morning we both awoke and leaped out of bed at the same instant\\nand ran and stripped aside the window-curtains; but we suffered a bitter\\ndisappointment again: it was already half past three in the afternoon.\\n\\nWe dressed sullenly and in ill spirits, each accusing the other of\\noversleeping. Harris said if we had brought the courier along, as we\\nought to have done, we should not have missed these sunrises. I said he\\nknew very well that one of us would have to sit up and wake the\\ncourier; and I added that we were having trouble enough to take care\\nof ourselves, on this climb, without having to take care of a courier\\nbesides.\\n\\nDuring breakfast our spirits came up a little, since we found by this\\nguide-book that in the hotels on the summit the tourist is not left to\\ntrust to luck for his sunrise, but is roused betimes by a man who goes\\nthrough the halls with a great Alpine horn, blowing blasts that would\\nraise the dead. And there was another consoling thing: the guide-book\\nsaid that up there on the summit the guests did not wait to dress much,\\nbut seized a red bed blanket and sailed out arrayed like an Indian. This\\nwas good; this would be romantic; two hundred and fifty people grouped\\non the windy summit, with their hair flying and their red blankets\\nflapping, in the solemn presence of the coming sun, would be a striking\\nand memorable spectacle. So it was good luck, not ill luck, that we had\\nmissed those other sunrises.\\n\\nWe were informed by the guide-book that we were now 3,228 feet above\\nthe level of the lake--therefore full two-thirds of our journey had been\\naccomplished. We got away at a quarter past four P.M.; a hundred yards\\nabove the hotel the railway divided; one track went straight up the\\nsteep hill, the other one turned square off to the right, with a very\\nslight grade. We took the latter, and followed it more than a mile,\\nturned a rocky corner, and came in sight of a handsome new hotel. If we\\nhad gone on, we should have arrived at the summit, but Harris\\npreferred to ask a lot of questions--as usual, of a man who didn\\'t know\\nanything--and he told us to go back and follow the other route. We did\\nso. We could ill afford this loss of time.\\n\\nWe climbed and climbed; and we kept on climbing; we reached about forty\\nsummits, but there was always another one just ahead. It came on to\\nrain, and it rained in dead earnest. We were soaked through and it\\nwas bitter cold. Next a smoky fog of clouds covered the whole region\\ndensely, and we took to the railway-ties to keep from getting lost.\\nSometimes we slopped along in a narrow path on the left-hand side of the\\ntrack, but by and by when the fog blew aside a little and we saw that we\\nwere treading the rampart of a precipice and that our left elbows were\\nprojecting over a perfectly boundless and bottomless vacancy, we gasped,\\nand jumped for the ties again.\\n\\nThe night shut down, dark and drizzly and cold. About eight in the\\nevening the fog lifted and showed us a well-worn path which led up a\\nvery steep rise to the left. We took it, and as soon as we had got far\\nenough from the railway to render the finding it again an impossibility,\\nthe fog shut down on us once more.\\n\\nWe were in a bleak, unsheltered place, now, and had to trudge right\\nalong, in order to keep warm, though we rather expected to go over a\\nprecipice, sooner or later. About nine o\\'clock we made an important\\ndiscovery--that we were not in any path. We groped around a while on our\\nhands and knees, but we could not find it; so we sat down in the mud and\\nthe wet scant grass to wait.\\n\\nWe were terrified into this by being suddenly confronted with a vast\\nbody which showed itself vaguely for an instant and in the next instant\\nwas smothered in the fog again. It was really the hotel we were after,\\nmonstrously magnified by the fog, but we took it for the face of a\\nprecipice, and decided not to try to claw up it.\\n\\nWe sat there an hour, with chattering teeth and quivering bodies, and\\nquarreled over all sorts of trifles, but gave most of our attention to\\nabusing each other for the stupidity of deserting the railway-track. We\\nsat with our backs to the precipice, because what little wind there was\\ncame from that quarter. At some time or other the fog thinned a little;\\nwe did not know when, for we were facing the empty universe and the\\nthinness could not show; but at last Harris happened to look around, and\\nthere stood a huge, dim, spectral hotel where the precipice had been.\\nOne could faintly discern the windows and chimneys, and a dull blur of\\nlights. Our first emotion was deep, unutterable gratitude, our next was\\na foolish rage, born of the suspicion that possibly the hotel had been\\nvisible three-quarters of an hour while we sat there in those cold\\npuddles quarreling.\\n\\nYes, it was the Rigi-Kulm hotel--the one that occupies the extreme\\nsummit, and whose remote little sparkle of lights we had often seen\\nglinting high aloft among the stars from our balcony away down yonder\\nin Lucerne. The crusty portier and the crusty clerks gave us the\\nsurly reception which their kind deal out in prosperous times, but by\\nmollifying them with an extra display of obsequiousness and servility\\nwe finally got them to show us to the room which our boy had engaged for\\nus.\\n\\nWe got into some dry clothing, and while our supper was preparing we\\nloafed forsakenly through a couple of vast cavernous drawing-rooms,\\none of which had a stove in it. This stove was in a corner, and densely\\nwalled around with people. We could not get near the fire, so we moved\\nat large in the artic spaces, among a multitude of people who sat\\nsilent, smileless, forlorn, and shivering--thinking what fools they were\\nto come, perhaps. There were some Americans and some Germans, but one\\ncould see that the great majority were English.\\n\\nWe lounged into an apartment where there was a great crowd, to see\\nwhat was going on. It was a memento-magazine. The tourists were eagerly\\nbuying all sorts and styles of paper-cutters, marked \"Souvenir of the\\nRigi,\" with handles made of the little curved horn of the ostensible\\nchamois; there were all manner of wooden goblets and such things,\\nsimilarly marked. I was going to buy a paper-cutter, but I believed\\nI could remember the cold comfort of the Rigi-Kulm without it, so I\\nsmothered the impulse.\\n\\nSupper warmed us, and we went immediately to bed--but first, as Mr.\\nBaedeker requests all tourists to call his attention to any errors which\\nthey may find in his guide-books, I dropped him a line to inform him he\\nmissed it by just about three days. I had previously informed him of his\\nmistake about the distance from Allerheiligen to Oppenau, and had also\\ninformed the Ordnance Depart of the German government of the same error\\nin the imperial maps. I will add, here, that I never got any answer to\\nthose letters, or any thanks from either of those sources; and, what is\\nstill more discourteous, these corrections have not been made, either in\\nthe maps or the guide-books. But I will write again when I get time, for\\nmy letters may have miscarried.\\n\\nWe curled up in the clammy beds, and went to sleep without rocking. We\\nwere so sodden with fatigue that we never stirred nor turned over till\\nthe blooming blasts of the Alpine horn aroused us.\\n\\nIt may well be imagined that we did not lose any time. We snatched on\\na few odds and ends of clothing, cocooned ourselves in the proper red\\nblankets, and plunged along the halls and out into the whistling wind\\nbareheaded. We saw a tall wooden scaffolding on the very peak of the\\nsummit, a hundred yards away, and made for it. We rushed up the stairs\\nto the top of this scaffolding, and stood there, above the vast outlying\\nworld, with hair flying and ruddy blankets waving and cracking in the\\nfierce breeze.\\n\\n\"Fifteen minutes too late, at last!\" said Harris, in a vexed voice. \"The\\nsun is clear above the horizon.\"\\n\\n\"No matter,\" I said, \"it is a most magnificent spectacle, and we will\\nsee it do the rest of its rising anyway.\"\\n\\nIn a moment we were deeply absorbed in the marvel before us, and dead to\\neverything else. The great cloud-barred disk of the sun stood just above\\na limitless expanse of tossing white-caps--so to speak--a billowy chaos\\nof massy mountain domes and peaks draped in imperishable snow, and\\nflooded with an opaline glory of changing and dissolving splendors,\\nwhile through rifts in a black cloud-bank above the sun, radiating\\nlances of diamond dust shot to the zenith. The cloven valleys of the\\nlower world swam in a tinted mist which veiled the ruggedness of their\\ncrags and ribs and ragged forests, and turned all the forbidding region\\ninto a soft and rich and sensuous paradise.\\n\\nWe could not speak. We could hardly breathe. We could only gaze in\\ndrunken ecstasy and drink in it. Presently Harris exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Why--nation, it\\'s going _down_!\"\\n\\nPerfectly true. We had missed the _morning_ hornblow, and slept all day.\\nThis was stupefying.\\n\\nHarris said:\\n\\n\"Look here, the sun isn\\'t the spectacle--it\\'s _us_--stacked up here\\non top of this gallows, in these idiotic blankets, and two hundred and\\nfifty well-dressed men and women down here gawking up at us and not\\ncaring a straw whether the sun rises or sets, as long as they\\'ve\\ngot such a ridiculous spectacle as this to set down in their\\nmemorandum-books. They seem to be laughing their ribs loose, and there\\'s\\none girl there that appears to be going all to pieces. I never saw such\\na man as you before. I think you are the very last possibility in the\\nway of an ass.\"\\n\\n\"What have _I_ done?\" I answered, with heat.\\n\\n\"What have you done? You\\'ve got up at half past seven o\\'clock in the\\nevening to see the sun rise, that\\'s what you\\'ve done.\"\\n\\n\"And have you done any better, I\\'d like to know? I\\'ve always used to\\nget up with the lark, till I came under the petrifying influence of your\\nturgid intellect.\"\\n\\n\"_You_ used to get up with the lark--Oh, no doubt--you\\'ll get up with\\nthe hangman one of these days. But you ought to be ashamed to be jawing\\nhere like this, in a red blanket, on a forty-foot scaffold on top of the\\nAlps. And no end of people down here to boot; this isn\\'t any place for\\nan exhibition of temper.\"\\n\\nAnd so the customary quarrel went on. When the sun was fairly down, we\\nslipped back to the hotel in the charitable gloaming, and went to bed\\nagain. We had encountered the horn-blower on the way, and he had tried\\nto collect compensation, not only for announcing the sunset, which we\\ndid see, but for the sunrise, which we had totally missed; but we said\\nno, we only took our solar rations on the \"European plan\"--pay for what\\nyou get. He promised to make us hear his horn in the morning, if we were\\nalive.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\n\\n[Looking West for Sunrise]\\n\\nHe kept his word. We heard his horn and instantly got up. It was dark\\nand cold and wretched. As I fumbled around for the matches, knocking\\nthings down with my quaking hands, I wished the sun would rise in the\\nmiddle of the day, when it was warm and bright and cheerful, and one\\nwasn\\'t sleepy. We proceeded to dress by the gloom of a couple sickly\\ncandles, but we could hardly button anything, our hands shook so.\\nI thought of how many happy people there were in Europe, Asia, and\\nAmerica, and everywhere, who were sleeping peacefully in their beds,\\nand did not have to get up and see the Rigi sunrise--people who did\\nnot appreciate their advantage, as like as not, but would get up in the\\nmorning wanting more boons of Providence. While thinking these thoughts\\nI yawned, in a rather ample way, and my upper teeth got hitched on a\\nnail over the door, and while I was mounting a chair to free myself,\\nHarris drew the window-curtain, and said:\\n\\n\"Oh, this is luck! We shan\\'t have to go out at all--yonder are the\\nmountains, in full view.\"\\n\\nThat was glad news, indeed. It made us cheerful right away. One could\\nsee the grand Alpine masses dimly outlined against the black firmament,\\nand one or two faint stars blinking through rifts in the night. Fully\\nclothed, and wrapped in blankets, and huddled ourselves up, by the\\nwindow, with lighted pipes, and fell into chat, while we waited in\\nexceeding comfort to see how an Alpine sunrise was going to look by\\ncandlelight. By and by a delicate, spiritual sort of effulgence spread\\nitself by imperceptible degrees over the loftiest altitudes of the snowy\\nwastes--but there the effort seemed to stop. I said, presently:\\n\\n\"There is a hitch about this sunrise somewhere. It doesn\\'t seem to go.\\nWhat do you reckon is the matter with it?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know. It appears to hang fire somewhere. I never saw a sunrise\\nact like that before. Can it be that the hotel is playing anything on\\nus?\"\\n\\n\"Of course not. The hotel merely has a property interest in the sun, it\\nhas nothing to do with the management of it. It is a precarious kind of\\nproperty, too; a succession of total eclipses would probably ruin this\\ntavern. Now what can be the matter with this sunrise?\"\\n\\nHarris jumped up and said:\\n\\n\"I\\'ve got it! I know what\\'s the matter with it! We\\'ve been looking at\\nthe place where the sun _set_ last night!\"\\n\\n\"It is perfectly true! Why couldn\\'t you have thought of that sooner? Now\\nwe\\'ve lost another one! And all through your blundering. It was exactly\\nlike you to light a pipe and sit down to wait for the sun to rise in the\\nwest.\"\\n\\n\"It was exactly like me to find out the mistake, too. You never would\\nhave found it out. I find out all the mistakes.\"\\n\\n\"You make them all, too, else your most valuable faculty would be wasted\\non you. But don\\'t stop to quarrel, now--maybe we are not too late yet.\"\\n\\nBut we were. The sun was well up when we got to the exhibition-ground.\\n\\nOn our way up we met the crowd returning--men and women dressed in\\nall sorts of queer costumes, and exhibiting all degrees of cold and\\nwretchedness in their gaits and countenances. A dozen still remained on\\nthe ground when we reached there, huddled together about the scaffold\\nwith their backs to the bitter wind. They had their red guide-books open\\nat the diagram of the view, and were painfully picking out the several\\nmountains and trying to impress their names and positions on their\\nmemories. It was one of the saddest sights I ever saw.\\n\\nTwo sides of this place were guarded by railings, to keep people from\\nbeing blown over the precipices. The view, looking sheer down into\\nthe broad valley, eastward, from this great elevation--almost a\\nperpendicular mile--was very quaint and curious. Counties, towns, hilly\\nribs and ridges, wide stretches of green meadow, great forest tracts,\\nwinding streams, a dozen blue lakes, a block of busy steamboats--we saw\\nall this little world in unique circumstantiality of detail--saw it just\\nas the birds see it--and all reduced to the smallest of scales and as\\nsharply worked out and finished as a steel engraving. The numerous toy\\nvillages, with tiny spires projecting out of them, were just as the\\nchildren might have left them when done with play the day before; the\\nforest tracts were diminished to cushions of moss; one or two big lakes\\nwere dwarfed to ponds, the smaller ones to puddles--though they did not\\nlook like puddles, but like blue teardrops which had fallen and lodged\\nin slight depressions, conformable to their shapes, among the moss-beds\\nand the smooth levels of dainty green farm-land; the microscopic\\nsteamboats glided along, as in a city reservoir, taking a mighty time to\\ncover the distance between ports which seemed only a yard apart; and the\\nisthmus which separated two lakes looked as if one might stretch out on\\nit and lie with both elbows in the water, yet we knew invisible wagons\\nwere toiling across it and finding the distance a tedious one. This\\nbeautiful miniature world had exactly the appearance of those \"relief\\nmaps\" which reproduce nature precisely, with the heights and depressions\\nand other details graduated to a reduced scale, and with the rocks,\\ntrees, lakes, etc., colored after nature.\\n\\nI believed we could walk down to Waeggis or Vitznau in a day, but I knew\\nwe could go down by rail in about an hour, so I chose the latter method.\\nI wanted to see what it was like, anyway. The train came along about the\\nmiddle of the afternoon, and an odd thing it was. The locomotive-boiler\\nstood on end, and it and the whole locomotive were tilted sharply\\nbackward. There were two passenger-cars, roofed, but wide open all\\naround. These cars were not tilted back, but the seats were; this\\nenables the passenger to sit level while going down a steep incline.\\n\\nThere are three railway-tracks; the central one is cogged; the \"lantern\\nwheel\" of the engine grips its way along these cogs, and pulls the\\ntrain up the hill or retards its motion on the down trip. About the same\\nspeed--three miles an hour--is maintained both ways. Whether going up or\\ndown, the locomotive is always at the lower end of the train. It pushes\\nin the one case, braces back in the other. The passenger rides backward\\ngoing up, and faces forward going down.\\n\\nWe got front seats, and while the train moved along about fifty yards\\non level ground, I was not the least frightened; but now it started\\nabruptly downstairs, and I caught my breath. And I, like my neighbors,\\nunconsciously held back all I could, and threw my weight to the rear,\\nbut, of course, that did no particular good. I had slidden down the\\nbalusters when I was a boy, and thought nothing of it, but to slide down\\nthe balusters in a railway-train is a thing to make one\\'s flesh creep.\\nSometimes we had as much as ten yards of almost level ground, and this\\ngave us a few full breaths in comfort; but straightway we would turn a\\ncorner and see a long steep line of rails stretching down below us, and\\nthe comfort was at an end. One expected to see the locomotive pause,\\nor slack up a little, and approach this plunge cautiously, but it\\ndid nothing of the kind; it went calmly on, and went it reached the\\njumping-off place it made a sudden bow, and went gliding smoothly\\ndownstairs, untroubled by the circumstances.\\n\\nIt was wildly exhilarating to slide along the edge of the precipices,\\nafter this grisly fashion, and look straight down upon that far-off\\nvalley which I was describing a while ago.\\n\\nThere was no level ground at the Kaltbad station; the railbed was as\\nsteep as a roof; I was curious to see how the stop was going to be\\nmanaged. But it was very simple; the train came sliding down, and when\\nit reached the right spot it just stopped--that was all there was \"to\\nit\"--stopped on the steep incline, and when the exchange of passengers\\nand baggage had been made, it moved off and went sliding down again. The\\ntrain can be stopped anywhere, at a moment\\'s notice.\\n\\nThere was one curious effect, which I need not take the trouble to\\ndescribe--because I can scissor a description of it out of the railway\\ncompany\\'s advertising pamphlet, and save my ink:\\n\\n\"On the whole tour, particularly at the Descent, we undergo an optical\\nillusion which often seems to be incredible. All the shrubs, fir trees,\\nstables, houses, etc., seem to be bent in a slanting direction, as by an\\nimmense pressure of air. They are all standing awry, so much awry that\\nthe chalets and cottages of the peasants seem to be tumbling down. It\\nis the consequence of the steep inclination of the line. Those who\\nare seated in the carriage do not observe that they are going down a\\ndeclivity of twenty to twenty-five degrees (their seats being adapted\\nto this course of proceeding and being bent down at their backs). They\\nmistake their carriage and its horizontal lines for a proper measure of\\nthe normal plain, and therefore all the objects outside which really\\nare in a horizontal position must show a disproportion of twenty to\\ntwenty-five degrees declivity, in regard to the mountain.\"\\n\\nBy the time one reaches Kaltbad, he has acquired confidence in the\\nrailway, and he now ceases to try to ease the locomotive by holding\\nback. Thenceforth he smokes his pipe in serenity, and gazes out upon the\\nmagnificent picture below and about him with unfettered enjoyment. There\\nis nothing to interrupt the view or the breeze; it is like inspecting\\nthe world on the wing. However--to be exact--there is one place where\\nthe serenity lapses for a while; this is while one is crossing the\\nSchnurrtobel Bridge, a frail structure which swings its gossamer frame\\ndown through the dizzy air, over a gorge, like a vagrant spider-strand.\\n\\nOne has no difficulty in remembering his sins while the train is\\ncreeping down this bridge; and he repents of them, too; though he sees,\\nwhen he gets to Vitznau, that he need not have done it, the bridge was\\nperfectly safe.\\n\\nSo ends the eventual trip which we made to the Rigi-Kulm to see an\\nAlpine sunrise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXX\\n\\n[Harris Climbs Mountains for Me]\\n\\nAn hour\\'s sail brought us to Lucerne again. I judged it best to go to\\nbed and rest several days, for I knew that the man who undertakes to\\nmake the tour of Europe on foot must take care of himself.\\n\\nThinking over my plans, as mapped out, I perceived that they did not\\ntake in the Furka Pass, the Rhone Glacier, the Finsteraarhorn, the\\nWetterhorn, etc. I immediately examined the guide-book to see if these\\nwere important, and found they were; in fact, a pedestrian tour of\\nEurope could not be complete without them. Of course that decided me at\\nonce to see them, for I never allow myself to do things by halves, or in\\na slurring, slipshod way.\\n\\nI called in my agent and instructed him to go without delay and make a\\ncareful examination of these noted places, on foot, and bring me back a\\nwritten report of the result, for insertion in my book. I instructed\\nhim to go to Hospenthal as quickly as possible, and make his grand start\\nfrom there; to extend his foot expedition as far as the Giesbach fall,\\nand return to me from thence by diligence or mule. I told him to take\\nthe courier with him.\\n\\nHe objected to the courier, and with some show of reason, since he was\\nabout to venture upon new and untried ground; but I thought he might\\nas well learn how to take care of the courier now as later, therefore I\\nenforced my point. I said that the trouble, delay, and inconvenience\\nof traveling with a courier were balanced by the deep respect which a\\ncourier\\'s presence commands, and I must insist that as much style be\\nthrown into my journeys as possible.\\n\\nSo the two assumed complete mountaineering costumes and departed. A week\\nlater they returned, pretty well used up, and my agent handed me the\\nfollowing:\\n\\nOfficial Report\\n\\nOF A VISIT TO THE FURKA REGION.\\n\\nBy H. Harris, Agent\\n\\nAbout seven o\\'clock in the morning, with perfectly fine weather, we\\nstarted from Hospenthal, and arrived at the _maison_ on the Furka in\\na little under _quatre_ hours. The want of variety in the scenery\\nfrom Hospenthal made the _Kahkahponeeka_ wearisome; but let none be\\ndiscouraged; no one can fail to be completely _r\\'ecompens\\'ee_ for his\\nfatigue, when he sees, for the first time, the monarch of the Oberland,\\nthe tremendous Finsteraarhorn. A moment before all was dullness, but a\\n_pas_ further has placed us on the summit of the Furka; and exactly\\nin front of us, at a _hopow_ of only fifteen miles, this magnificent\\nmountain lifts its snow-wreathed precipices into the deep blue sky. The\\ninferior mountains on each side of the pass form a sort of frame for the\\npicture of their dread lord, and close in the view so completely that\\nno other prominent feature in the Oberland is visible from this\\n_bong-a-bong_; nothing withdraws the attention from the solitary\\ngrandeur of the Finsteraarhorn and the dependent spurs which form the\\nabutments of the central peak.\\n\\nWith the addition of some others, who were also bound for the Grimsel,\\nwe formed a large _xhvloj_ as we descended the _steg_ which winds round\\nthe shoulder of a mountain toward the Rhone Glacier. We soon left the\\npath and took to the ice; and after wandering amongst the crevices _un\\npeu_, to admire the wonders of these deep blue caverns, and hear the\\nrushing of waters through their subglacial channels, we struck out a\\ncourse toward _l\\'autre cravasse_ and crossed the glacier successfully, a\\nlittle above the cave from which the infant Rhone takes its first bound\\nfrom under the grand precipice of ice. Half a mile below this we began\\nto climb the flowery side of the Meienwand. One of our party started\\nbefore the rest, but the _hitze_ was so great, that we found _ihm_ quite\\nexhausted, and lying at full length in the shade of a large _gestein_.\\nWe sat down with him for a time, for all felt the heat exceedingly in\\nthe climb up this very steep _bolwoggoly_, and then we set out again\\ntogether, and arrived at last near the Dead Man\\'s Lake, at the foot\\nof the Sidelhorn. This lonely spot, once used for an extempore\\nburying-place, after a sanguinary _battue_ between the French and\\nAustrians, is the perfection of desolation; there is nothing in sight to\\nmark the hand of man, except the line of weather-beaten whitened posts,\\nset up to indicate the direction of the pass in the _owdawakk_ of\\nwinter. Near this point the footpath joins the wider track, which\\nconnects the Grimsel with the head of the Rhone _schnawp_; this has been\\ncarefully constructed, and leads with a tortuous course among and over\\n_les pierres_, down to the bank of the gloomy little swosh-swosh, which\\nalmost washes against the walls of the Grimsel Hospice. We arrived a\\nlittle before four o\\'clock at the end of our day\\'s journey, hot enough\\nto justify the step, taking by most of the _partie_, of plunging into\\nthe crystal water of the snow-fed lake.\\n\\nThe next afternoon we started for a walk up the Unteraar glacier, with\\nthe intention of, at all events, getting as far as the Hutte which is\\nused as a sleeping-place by most of those who cross the Strahleck\\nPass to Grindelwald. We got over the tedious collection of stones and\\n_dbris_ which covers the _pied_ of the _gletcher_, and had walked\\nnearly three hours from the Grimsel, when, just as we were thinking of\\ncrossing over to the right, to climb the cliffs at the foot of the hut,\\nthe clouds, which had for some time assumed a threatening appearance,\\nsuddenly dropped, and a huge mass of them, driving toward us from\\nthe Finsteraarhorn, poured down a deluge of _haboolong_ and hail.\\nFortunately, we were not far from a very large glacier-table; it was a\\nhuge rock balanced on a pedestal of ice high enough to admit of our\\nall creeping under it for _gowkarak_. A stream of _puckittypukk_ had\\nfurrowed a course for itself in the ice at its base, and we were obliged\\nto stand with one _fuss_ on each side of this, and endeavor to keep\\nourselves _chaud_ by cutting steps in the steep bank of the pedestal, so\\nas to get a higher place for standing on, as the _wasser_ rose rapidly\\nin its trench. A very cold _bzzzzzzzzeee_ accompanied the storm, and\\nmade our position far from pleasant; and presently came a flash of\\n_blitzen_, apparently in the middle of our little party, with an\\ninstantaneous clap of _yokky_, sounding like a large gun fired close to\\nour ears; the effect was startling; but in a few seconds our attention\\nwas fixed by the roaring echoes of the thunder against the tremendous\\nmountains which completely surrounded us. This was followed by many more\\nbursts, none of _welche_, however, was so dangerously near; and after\\nwaiting a long _demi_-hour in our icy prison, we sallied out to talk\\nthrough a _haboolong_ which, though not so heavy as before, was quite\\nenough to give us a thorough soaking before our arrival at the Hospice.\\n\\nThe Grimsel is _certainement_ a wonderful place; situated at the\\nbottom of a sort of huge crater, the sides of which are utterly savage\\n_gebirge_, composed of barren rocks which cannot even support a single\\npine _arbre_, and afford only scanty food for a herd of _gmwkwllolp_,\\nit looks as if it must be completely _begraben_ in the winter snows.\\nEnormous avalanches fall against it every spring, sometimes covering\\neverything to the depth of thirty or forty feet; and, in spite of walls\\nfour feet thick, and furnished with outside shutters, the two men who\\nstay here when the _voyageurs_ are snugly quartered in their distant\\nhomes can tell you that the snow sometimes shakes the house to its\\nfoundations.\\n\\nNext morning the _hogglebumgullup_ still continued bad, but we made\\nup our minds to go on, and make the best of it. Half an hour after we\\nstarted, the _regen_ thickened unpleasantly, and we attempted to get\\nshelter under a projecting rock, but being far to _nass_ already to\\nmake standing at all _agrable_, we pushed on for the Handeck, consoling\\nourselves with the reflection that from the furious rushing of the river\\nAar at our side, we should at all events see the celebrated _wasserfall_\\nin _grande perfection_. Nor were we _nappersocket_ in our expectation;\\nthe water was roaring down its leap of two hundred and fifty feet in a\\nmost magnificent frenzy, while the trees which cling to its rocky sides\\nswayed to and fro in the violence of the hurricane which it brought down\\nwith it; even the stream, which falls into the main cascade at right\\nangles, and _toutefois_ forms a beautiful feature in the scene, was now\\nswollen into a raging torrent; and the violence of this \"meeting of the\\nwaters,\" about fifty feet below the frail bridge where we stood, was\\nfearfully grand. While we were looking at it, _glecklicheweise_ a gleam\\nof sunshine came out, and instantly a beautiful rainbow was formed by\\nthe spray, and hung in mid-air suspended over the awful gorge.\\n\\nOn going into the _chalet_ above the fall, we were informed that a\\n_bruecke_ had broken down near Guttanen, and that it would be impossible\\nto proceed for some time; accordingly we were kept in our drenched\\ncondition for _ein stunde_, when some _voyageurs_ arrived from\\nMeiringen, and told us that there had been a trifling accident, _aber_\\nthat we could now cross. On arriving at the spot, I was much inclined\\nto suspect that the whole story was a ruse to make us _slowwk_ and drink\\nthe more at the Handeck Inn, for only a few planks had been carried\\naway, and though there might perhaps have been some difficulty with\\nmules, the gap was certainly not larger than a _mmbglx_ might cross with\\na very slight leap. Near Guttanen the _haboolong_ happily ceased, and we\\nhad time to walk ourselves tolerably dry before arriving at Reichenback,\\n_so_ we enjoyed a good _dinr_ at the Hotel des Alps.\\n\\nNext morning we walked to Rosenlaui, the _beau idal_ of Swiss scenery,\\nwhere we spent the middle of the day in an excursion to the glacier.\\nThis was more beautiful than words can describe, for in the constant\\nprogress of the ice it has changed the form of its extremity and formed\\na vast cavern, as blue as the sky above, and rippled like a frozen\\nocean. A few steps cut in the _whoopjamboreehoo_ enabled us to walk\\ncompletely under this, and feast our eyes upon one of the loveliest\\nobjects in creation. The glacier was all around divided by numberless\\nfissures of the same exquisite color, and the finest wood-_erdbeeren_\\nwere growing in abundance but a few yards from the ice. The inn stands\\nin a _charmant_ spot close to the _Cot de la rivire_, which, lower\\ndown, forms the Reichenbach fall, and embosomed in the richest of\\npine woods, while the fine form of the Wellhorn looking down upon it\\ncompletes the enchanting _bopple_. In the afternoon we walked over the\\nGreat Scheideck to Grindelwald, stopping to pay a visit to the Upper\\nglacier by the way; but we were again overtaken by bad _hogglebumgullup_\\nand arrived at the hotel in a _solche_ a state that the landlord\\'s\\nwardrobe was in great request.\\n\\nThe clouds by this time seemed to have done their worst, for a lovely\\nday succeeded, which we determined to devote to an ascent of the\\nFaulhorn. We left Grindelwald just as a thunder-storm was dying away,\\nand we hoped to find _guten wetter_ up above; but the rain, which had\\nnearly ceased, began again, and we were struck by the rapidly increasing\\n_froid_ as we ascended. Two-thirds of the way up were completed when\\nthe rain was exchanged for _gnillic_, with which the _boden_ was thickly\\ncovered, and before we arrived at the top the _gnillic_ and mist became\\nso thick that we could not see one another at more than twenty _poopoo_\\ndistance, and it became difficult to pick our way over the rough and\\nthickly covered ground. Shivering with cold, we turned into bed with a\\ndouble allowance of clothes, and slept comfortably while the wind howled\\n_autour de la maison_; when I awoke, the wall and the window looked\\nequally dark, but in another hour I found I could just see the form\\nof the latter; so I jumped out of bed, and forced it open, though with\\ngreat difficulty from the frost and the quantities of _gnillic_ heaped\\nup against it.\\n\\nA row of huge icicles hung down from the edge of the roof, and anything\\nmore wintry than the whole _anblick_ could not well be imagined; but the\\nsudden appearance of the great mountains in front was so startling\\nthat I felt no inclination to move toward bed again. The snow which\\nhad collected upon _la fnetre_ had increased the _finsterniss oder der\\ndunkelheit_, so that when I looked out I was surprised to find that the\\ndaylight was considerable, and that the _balragoomah_ would evidently\\nrise before long. Only the brightest of _les toiles_ were still\\nshining; the sky was cloudless overhead, though small curling mists lay\\nthousands of feet below us in the valleys, wreathed around the feet of\\nthe mountains, and adding to the splendor of their lofty summits. We\\nwere soon dressed and out of the house, watching the gradual approach of\\ndawn, thoroughly absorbed in the first near view of the Oberland giants,\\nwhich broke upon us unexpectedly after the intense obscurity of the\\nevening before. \"_Kabaugwakko songwashee kum wetterhorn snawpo_!\" cried\\nsome one, as that grand summit gleamed with the first rose of dawn;\\nand in a few moments the double crest of the Schreckhorn followed its\\nexample; peak after peak seemed warmed with life, the Jungfrau blushed\\neven more beautifully than her neighbors, and soon, from the Wetterhorn\\nin the east to the Wildstrubel in the west, a long row of fires glowed\\nupon mighty altars, truly worthy of the gods.\\n\\nThe _wlgw_ was very severe; our sleeping-place could hardly be\\n_distingue_ from the snow around it, which had fallen to a depth of\\na _flirk_ during the past evening, and we heartily enjoyed a rough\\nscramble _en bas_ to the Giesbach falls, where we soon found a warm\\nclimate. At noon the day before Grindelwald the thermometer could\\nnot have stood at less than 100 degrees Fahr. in the sun; and in the\\nevening, judging from the icicles formed, and the state of the windows,\\nthere must have been at least twelve _dingblatter_ of frost, thus giving\\na change of 80 degrees during a few hours.\\n\\nI said:\\n\\n\"You have done well, Harris; this report is concise, compact, well\\nexpressed; the language is crisp, the descriptions are vivid and not\\nneedlessly elaborated; your report goes straight to the point, attends\\nstrictly to business, and doesn\\'t fool around. It is in many ways an\\nexcellent document. But it has a fault--it is too learned, it is much\\ntoo learned. What is \\'_dingblatter_\\'?\\n\\n\"\\'_Dingblatter_\\' is a Fiji word meaning \\'degrees.\\'\"\\n\\n\"You knew the English of it, then?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes.\"\\n\\n\"What is \\'_gnillic_\\'?\\n\\n\"That is the Eskimo term for \\'snow.\\'\"\\n\\n\"So you knew the English for that, too?\"\\n\\n\"Why, certainly.\"\\n\\n\"What does \\'_mmbglx_\\' stand for?\"\\n\\n\"That is Zulu for \\'pedestrian.\\'\"\\n\\n\"\\'While the form of the Wellhorn looking down upon it completes the\\nenchanting _bopple_.\\' What is \\'_bopple_\\'?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Picture.\\' It\\'s Choctaw.\"\\n\\n\"What is \\'_schnawp_\\'?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Valley.\\' That is Choctaw, also.\"\\n\\n\"What is \\'_bolwoggoly_\\'?\"\\n\\n\"That is Chinese for \\'hill.\\'\"\\n\\n\"\\'_kahkahponeeka_\\'?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Ascent.\\' Choctaw.\"\\n\\n\"\\'But we were again overtaken by bad _hogglebumgullup_.\\' What does\\n\\'_hogglebumgullup_\\' mean?\"\\n\\n\"That is Chinese for \\'weather.\\'\"\\n\\n\"Is \\'_hogglebumgullup_\\' better than the English word? Is it any more\\ndescriptive?\"\\n\\n\"No, it means just the same.\"\\n\\n\"And \\'_dingblatter\\' and \\'gnillic,\\' and \\'bopple,\\' and \\'schnawp_\\'--are\\nthey better than the English words?\"\\n\\n\"No, they mean just what the English ones do.\"\\n\\n\"Then why do you use them? Why have you used all this Chinese and\\nChoctaw and Zulu rubbish?\"\\n\\n\"Because I didn\\'t know any French but two or three words, and I didn\\'t\\nknow any Latin or Greek at all.\"\\n\\n\"That is nothing. Why should you want to use foreign words, anyhow?\"\\n\\n\"They adorn my page. They all do it.\"\\n\\n\"Who is \\'all\\'?\"\\n\\n\"Everybody. Everybody that writes elegantly. Anybody has a right to that\\nwants to.\"\\n\\n\"I think you are mistaken.\" I then proceeded in the following scathing\\nmanner. \"When really learned men write books for other learned men\\nto read, they are justified in using as many learned words as they\\nplease--their audience will understand them; but a man who writes a book\\nfor the general public to read is not justified in disfiguring his pages\\nwith untranslated foreign expressions. It is an insolence toward the\\nmajority of the purchasers, for it is a very frank and impudent way of\\nsaying, \\'Get the translations made yourself if you want them, this\\nbook is not written for the ignorant classes.\\' There are men who know\\na foreign language so well and have used it so long in their daily\\nlife that they seem to discharge whole volleys of it into their English\\nwritings unconsciously, and so they omit to translate, as much as\\nhalf the time. That is a great cruelty to nine out of ten of the man\\'s\\nreaders. What is the excuse for this? The writer would say he only uses\\nthe foreign language where the delicacy of his point cannot be conveyed\\nin English. Very well, then he writes his best things for the tenth man,\\nand he ought to warn the nine other not to buy his book. However, the\\nexcuse he offers is at least an excuse; but there is another set of\\nmen who are like _you_; they know a _word_ here and there, of a foreign\\nlanguage, or a few beggarly little three-word phrases, filched from the\\nback of the Dictionary, and these are continually peppering into their\\nliterature, with a pretense of knowing that language--what excuse can\\nthey offer? The foreign words and phrases which they use have their\\nexact equivalents in a nobler language--English; yet they think they\\n\\'adorn their page\\' when they say _strasse_ for street, and _bahnhof_ for\\nrailway-station, and so on--flaunting these fluttering rags of poverty\\nin the reader\\'s face and imagining he will be ass enough to take\\nthem for the sign of untold riches held in reserve. I will let your\\n\\'learning\\' remain in your report; you have as much right, I suppose, to\\n\\'adorn your page\\' with Zulu and Chinese and Choctaw rubbish as others of\\nyour sort have to adorn theirs with insolent odds and ends smouched from\\nhalf a dozen learned tongues whose _a-b abs_ they don\\'t even know.\"\\n\\nWhen the musing spider steps upon the red-hot shovel, he first exhibits\\na wild surprise, then he shrivels up. Similar was the effect of these\\nblistering words upon the tranquil and unsuspecting Agent. I can be\\ndreadfully rough on a person when the mood takes me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXI\\n\\n[Alp-scaling by Carriage]\\n\\nWe now prepared for a considerable walk--from Lucerne to Interlaken,\\nover the Bruenig Pass. But at the last moment the weather was so good\\nthat I changed my mind and hired a four-horse carriage. It was a huge\\nvehicle, roomy, as easy in its motion as a palanquin, and exceedingly\\ncomfortable.\\n\\nWe got away pretty early in the morning, after a hot breakfast, and\\nwent bowling over a hard, smooth road, through the summer loveliness of\\nSwitzerland, with near and distant lakes and mountains before and about\\nus for the entertainment of the eye, and the music of multitudinous\\nbirds to charm the ear. Sometimes there was only the width of the road\\nbetween the imposing precipices on the right and the clear cool water on\\nthe left with its shoals of uncatchable fish skimming about through the\\nbars of sun and shadow; and sometimes, in place of the precipices, the\\ngrassy land stretched away, in an apparently endless upward slant,\\nand was dotted everywhere with snug little chalets, the peculiarly\\ncaptivating cottage of Switzerland.\\n\\nThe ordinary chalet turns a broad, honest gable end to the road, and\\nits ample roof hovers over the home in a protecting, caressing way,\\nprojecting its sheltering eaves far outward. The quaint windows are\\nfilled with little panes, and garnished with white muslin curtains,\\nand brightened with boxes of blooming flowers. Across the front of the\\nhouse, and up the spreading eaves and along the fanciful railings of\\nthe shallow porch, are elaborate carvings--wreaths, fruits, arabesques,\\nverses from Scripture, names, dates, etc. The building is wholly of\\nwood, reddish brown in tint, a very pleasing color. It generally has\\nvines climbing over it. Set such a house against the fresh green of the\\nhillside, and it looks ever so cozy and inviting and picturesque, and is\\na decidedly graceful addition to the landscape.\\n\\nOne does not find out what a hold the chalet has taken upon him, until\\nhe presently comes upon a new house--a house which is aping the town\\nfashions of Germany and France, a prim, hideous, straight-up-and-down\\nthing, plastered all over on the outside to look like stone, and\\naltogether so stiff, and formal, and ugly, and forbidding, and so out of\\ntune with the gracious landscape, and so deaf and dumb and dead to the\\npoetry of its surroundings, that it suggests an undertaker at a picnic,\\na corpse at a wedding, a puritan in Paradise.\\n\\nIn the course of the morning we passed the spot where Pontius Pilate is\\nsaid to have thrown himself into the lake. The legend goes that after\\nthe Crucifixion his conscience troubled him, and he fled from Jerusalem\\nand wandered about the earth, weary of life and a prey to tortures\\nof the mind. Eventually, he hid himself away, on the heights of Mount\\nPilatus, and dwelt alone among the clouds and crags for years; but rest\\nand peace were still denied him, so he finally put an end to his misery\\nby drowning himself.\\n\\nPresently we passed the place where a man of better odor was born. This\\nwas the children\\'s friend, Santa Claus, or St. Nicholas. There are some\\nunaccountable reputations in the world. This saint\\'s is an instance. He\\nhas ranked for ages as the peculiar friend of children, yet it appears\\nhe was not much of a friend to his own. He had ten of them, and when\\nfifty years old he left them, and sought out as dismal a refuge from the\\nworld as possible, and became a hermit in order that he might reflect\\nupon pious themes without being disturbed by the joyous and other noises\\nfrom the nursery, doubtless.\\n\\nJudging by Pilate and St. Nicholas, there exists no rule for the\\nconstruction of hermits; they seem made out of all kinds of material.\\nBut Pilate attended to the matter of expiating his sin while he was\\nalive, whereas St. Nicholas will probably have to go on climbing down\\nsooty chimneys, Christmas eve, forever, and conferring kindness on other\\npeople\\'s children, to make up for deserting his own. His bones are kept\\nin a church in a village (Sachseln) which we visited, and are naturally\\nheld in great reverence. His portrait is common in the farmhouses of\\nthe region, but is believed by many to be but an indifferent likeness.\\nDuring his hermit life, according to legend, he partook of the bread\\nand wine of the communion once a month, but all the rest of the month he\\nfasted.\\n\\nA constant marvel with us, as we sped along the bases of the steep\\nmountains on this journey, was, not that avalanches occur, but that they\\nare not occurring all the time. One does not understand why rocks\\nand landslides do not plunge down these declivities daily. A landslip\\noccurred three quarters of a century ago, on the route from Arth to\\nBrunnen, which was a formidable thing. A mass of conglomerate two miles\\nlong, a thousand feet broad, and a hundred feet thick, broke away from a\\ncliff three thousand feet high and hurled itself into the valley below,\\nburying four villages and five hundred people, as in a grave.\\n\\nWe had such a beautiful day, and such endless pictures of limpid lakes,\\nand green hills and valleys, and majestic mountains, and milky cataracts\\ndancing down the steeps and gleaming in the sun, that we could not help\\nfeeling sweet toward all the world; so we tried to drink all the\\nmilk, and eat all the grapes and apricots and berries, and buy all the\\nbouquets of wild flowers which the little peasant boys and girls offered\\nfor sale; but we had to retire from this contract, for it was too heavy.\\n\\nAt short distances--and they were entirely too short--all along the\\nroad, were groups of neat and comely children, with their wares nicely\\nand temptingly set forth in the grass under the shade trees, and as soon\\nas we approached they swarmed into the road, holding out their baskets\\nand milk bottles, and ran beside the carriage, barefoot and bareheaded,\\nand importuned us to buy. They seldom desisted early, but continued to\\nrun and insist--beside the wagon while they could, and behind it until\\nthey lost breath. Then they turned and chased a returning carriage back\\nto their trading-post again. After several hours of this, without any\\nintermission, it becomes almost annoying. I do not know what we should\\nhave done without the returning carriages to draw off the pursuit.\\nHowever, there were plenty of these, loaded with dusty tourists and\\npiled high with luggage. Indeed, from Lucerne to Interlaken we had\\nthe spectacle, among other scenery, of an unbroken procession of\\nfruit-peddlers and tourists carriages.\\n\\nOur talk was mostly anticipatory of what we should see on the down-grade\\nof the Bruenig, by and by, after we should pass the summit. All our\\nfriends in Lucerne had said that to look down upon Meiringen, and the\\nrushing blue-gray river Aar, and the broad level green valley; and\\nacross at the mighty Alpine precipices that rise straight up to the\\nclouds out of that valley; and up at the microscopic chalets perched\\nupon the dizzy eaves of those precipices and winking dimly and fitfully\\nthrough the drifting veil of vapor; and still up and up, at the superb\\nOltschiback and the other beautiful cascades that leap from those rugged\\nheights, robed in powdery spray, ruffled with foam, and girdled with\\nrainbows--to look upon these things, they say, was to look upon the last\\npossibility of the sublime and the enchanting. Therefore, as I say,\\nwe talked mainly of these coming wonders; if we were conscious of any\\nimpatience, it was to get there in favorable season; if we felt any\\nanxiety, it was that the day might remain perfect, and enable us to see\\nthose marvels at their best.\\n\\nAs we approached the Kaiserstuhl, a part of the harness gave way.\\n\\nWe were in distress for a moment, but only a moment. It was the\\nfore-and-aft gear that was broken--the thing that leads aft from the\\nforward part of the horse and is made fast to the thing that pulls the\\nwagon. In America this would have been a heavy leathern strap; but, all\\nover the continent it is nothing but a piece of rope the size of\\nyour little finger--clothes-line is what it is. Cabs use it, private\\ncarriages, freight-carts and wagons, all sorts of vehicles have it. In\\nMunich I afterward saw it used on a long wagon laden with fifty-four\\nhalf-barrels of beer; I had before noticed that the cabs in Heidelberg\\nused it--not new rope, but rope that had been in use since Abraham\\'s\\ntime--and I had felt nervous, sometimes, behind it when the cab was\\ntearing down a hill. But I had long been accustomed to it now, and had\\neven become afraid of the leather strap which belonged in its place. Our\\ndriver got a fresh piece of clothes-line out of his locker and repaired\\nthe break in two minutes.\\n\\nSo much for one European fashion. Every country has its own ways. It may\\ninterest the reader to know how they \"put horses to\" on the continent.\\nThe man stands up the horses on each side of the thing that projects\\nfrom the front end of the wagon, and then throws the tangled mess of\\ngear forward through a ring, and hauls it aft, and passes the other\\nthing through the other ring and hauls it aft on the other side of the\\nother horse, opposite to the first one, after crossing them and bringing\\nthe loose end back, and then buckles the other thing underneath the\\nhorse, and takes another thing and wraps it around the thing I spoke\\nof before, and puts another thing over each horse\\'s head, with broad\\nflappers to it to keep the dust out of his eyes, and puts the iron thing\\nin his mouth for him to grit his teeth on, uphill, and brings the ends\\nof these things aft over his back, after buckling another one around\\nunder his neck to hold his head up, and hitching another thing on\\na thing that goes over his shoulders to keep his head up when he is\\nclimbing a hill, and then takes the slack of the thing which I mentioned\\na while ago, and fetches it aft and makes it fast to the thing that\\npulls the wagon, and hands the other things up to the driver to steer\\nwith. I never have buckled up a horse myself, but I do not think we do\\nit that way.\\n\\nWe had four very handsome horses, and the driver was very proud of his\\nturnout. He would bowl along on a reasonable trot, on the highway, but\\nwhen he entered a village he did it on a furious run, and accompanied it\\nwith a frenzy of ceaseless whip-crackings that sounded like volleys of\\nmusketry. He tore through the narrow streets and around the sharp curves\\nlike a moving earthquake, showering his volleys as he went, and before\\nhim swept a continuous tidal wave of scampering children, ducks, cats,\\nand mothers clasping babies which they had snatched out of the way of\\nthe coming destruction; and as this living wave washed aside, along the\\nwalls, its elements, being safe, forgot their fears and turned their\\nadmiring gaze upon that gallant driver till he thundered around the next\\ncurve and was lost to sight.\\n\\nHe was a great man to those villagers, with his gaudy clothes and his\\nterrific ways. Whenever he stopped to have his cattle watered and fed\\nwith loaves of bread, the villagers stood around admiring him while\\nhe swaggered about, the little boys gazed up at his face with humble\\nhomage, and the landlord brought out foaming mugs of beer and conversed\\nproudly with him while he drank. Then he mounted his lofty box, swung\\nhis explosive whip, and away he went again, like a storm. I had not\\nseen anything like this before since I was a boy, and the stage used to\\nflourish the village with the dust flying and the horn tooting.\\n\\nWhen we reached the base of the Kaiserstuhl, we took two more horses; we\\nhad to toil along with difficulty for an hour and a half or two hours,\\nfor the ascent was not very gradual, but when we passed the backbone and\\napproached the station, the driver surpassed all his previous efforts in\\nthe way of rush and clatter. He could not have six horses all the time,\\nso he made the most of his chance while he had it.\\n\\nUp to this point we had been in the heart of the William Tell region.\\nThe hero is not forgotten, by any means, or held in doubtful veneration.\\nHis wooden image, with his bow drawn, above the doors of taverns, was a\\nfrequent feature of the scenery.\\n\\nAbout noon we arrived at the foot of the Bruenig Pass, and made a\\ntwo-hour stop at the village hotel, another of those clean, pretty, and\\nthoroughly well-kept inns which are such an astonishment to people\\nwho are accustomed to hotels of a dismally different pattern in remote\\ncountry-towns. There was a lake here, in the lap of the great mountains,\\nthe green slopes that rose toward the lower crags were graced with\\nscattered Swiss cottages nestling among miniature farms and gardens,\\nand from out a leafy ambuscade in the upper heights tumbled a brawling\\ncataract.\\n\\nCarriage after carriage, laden with tourists and trunks, arrived, and\\nthe quiet hotel was soon populous. We were early at the table d\\'hte and\\nsaw the people all come in. There were twenty-five, perhaps. They were\\nof various nationalities, but we were the only Americans. Next to me sat\\nan English bride, and next to her sat her new husband, whom she called\\n\"Neddy,\" though he was big enough and stalwart enough to be entitled to\\nhis full name. They had a pretty little lovers\\' quarrel over what wine\\nthey should have. Neddy was for obeying the guide-book and taking the\\nwine of the country; but the bride said:\\n\\n\"What, that nahsty stuff!\"\\n\\n\"It isn\\'t nahsty, pet, it\\'s quite good.\"\\n\\n\"It _is_ nahsty.\"\\n\\n\"No, it _isn\\'t_ nahsty.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s Oful nahsty, Neddy, and I shahn\\'t drink it.\"\\n\\nThen the question was, what she must have. She said he knew very well\\nthat she never drank anything but champagne.\\n\\nShe added:\\n\\n\"You know very well papa always has champagne on his table, and I\\'ve\\nalways been used to it.\"\\n\\nNeddy made a playful pretense of being distressed about the expense,\\nand this amused her so much that she nearly exhausted herself with\\nlaughter--and this pleased _him_ so much that he repeated his jest a\\ncouple of times, and added new and killing varieties to it. When the\\nbride finally recovered, she gave Neddy a love-box on the arm with her\\nfan, and said with arch severity:\\n\\n\"Well, you would _have_ me--nothing else would do--so you\\'ll have to\\nmake the best of a bad bargain. _Do_ order the champagne, I\\'m Oful dry.\"\\n\\nSo with a mock groan which made her laugh again, Neddy ordered the\\nchampagne.\\n\\nThe fact that this young woman had never moistened the selvedge edge of\\nher soul with a less plebeian tipple than champagne, had a marked and\\nsubduing effect on Harris. He believed she belonged to the royal family.\\nBut I had my doubts.\\n\\nWe heard two or three different languages spoken by people at the\\ntable and guessed out the nationalities of most of the guests to our\\nsatisfaction, but we failed with an elderly gentleman and his wife and\\na young girl who sat opposite us, and with a gentleman of about\\nthirty-five who sat three seats beyond Harris. We did not hear any of\\nthese speak. But finally the last-named gentleman left while we were not\\nnoticing, but we looked up as he reached the far end of the table. He\\nstopped there a moment, and made his toilet with a pocket comb. So he\\nwas a German; or else he had lived in German hotels long enough to catch\\nthe fashion. When the elderly couple and the young girl rose to leave,\\nthey bowed respectfully to us. So they were Germans, too. This national\\ncustom is worth six of the other one, for export.\\n\\nAfter dinner we talked with several Englishmen, and they inflamed our\\ndesire to a hotter degree than ever, to see the sights of Meiringen from\\nthe heights of the Bruenig Pass. They said the view was marvelous, and\\nthat one who had seen it once could never forget it. They also spoke of\\nthe romantic nature of the road over the pass, and how in one place it\\nhad been cut through a flank of the solid rock, in such a way that the\\nmountain overhung the tourist as he passed by; and they furthermore said\\nthat the sharp turns in the road and the abruptness of the descent would\\nafford us a thrilling experience, for we should go down in a flying\\ngallop and seem to be spinning around the rings of a whirlwind, like a\\ndrop of whiskey descending the spirals of a corkscrew.\\n\\nI got all the information out of these gentlemen that we could need; and\\nthen, to make everything complete, I asked them if a body could get hold\\nof a little fruit and milk here and there, in case of necessity. They\\nthrew up their hands in speechless intimation that the road was simply\\npaved with refreshment-peddlers. We were impatient to get away, now, and\\nthe rest of our two-hour stop rather dragged. But finally the set time\\narrived and we began the ascent. Indeed it was a wonderful road. It was\\nsmooth, and compact, and clean, and the side next the precipices was\\nguarded all along by dressed stone posts about three feet high, placed\\nat short distances apart. The road could not have been better built if\\nNapoleon the First had built it. He seems to have been the introducer of\\nthe sort of roads which Europe now uses. All literature which describes\\nlife as it existed in England, France, and Germany up to the close\\nof the last century, is filled with pictures of coaches and carriages\\nwallowing through these three countries in mud and slush half-wheel\\ndeep; but after Napoleon had floundered through a conquered kingdom he\\ngenerally arranged things so that the rest of the world could follow\\ndry-shod.\\n\\nWe went on climbing, higher and higher, and curving hither and thither,\\nin the shade of noble woods, and with a rich variety and profusion of\\nwild flowers all about us; and glimpses of rounded grassy backbones\\nbelow us occupied by trim chalets and nibbling sheep, and other glimpses\\nof far lower altitudes, where distance diminished the chalets to toys\\nand obliterated the sheep altogether; and every now and then some\\nermined monarch of the Alps swung magnificently into view for a moment,\\nthen drifted past an intervening spur and disappeared again.\\n\\nIt was an intoxicating trip altogether; the exceeding sense of\\nsatisfaction that follows a good dinner added largely to the enjoyment;\\nthe having something especial to look forward to and muse about, like\\nthe approaching grandeurs of Meiringen, sharpened the zest. Smoking\\nwas never so good before, solid comfort was never solider; we lay back\\nagainst the thick cushions silent, meditative, steeped in felicity.\\n\\n* * * * * * * *\\n\\nI rubbed my eyes, opened them, and started. I had been dreaming I was at\\nsea, and it was a thrilling surprise to wake up and find land all around\\nme. It took me a couple seconds to \"come to,\" as you may say; then I\\ntook in the situation. The horses were drinking at a trough in the edge\\nof a town, the driver was taking beer, Harris was snoring at my side,\\nthe courier, with folded arms and bowed head, was sleeping on the box,\\ntwo dozen barefooted and bareheaded children were gathered about the\\ncarriage, with their hands crossed behind, gazing up with serious and\\ninnocent admiration at the dozing tourists baking there in the sun.\\nSeveral small girls held night-capped babies nearly as big as themselves\\nin their arms, and even these fat babies seemed to take a sort of\\nsluggish interest in us.\\n\\nWe had slept an hour and a half and missed all the scenery! I did not\\nneed anybody to tell me that. If I had been a girl, I could have cursed\\nfor vexation. As it was, I woke up the agent and gave him a piece of\\nmy mind. Instead of being humiliated, he only upbraided me for being\\nso wanting in vigilance. He said he had expected to improve his mind by\\ncoming to Europe, but a man might travel to the ends of the earth with\\nme and never see anything, for I was manifestly endowed with the very\\ngenius of ill luck. He even tried to get up some emotion about that\\npoor courier, who never got a chance to see anything, on account of my\\nheedlessness. But when I thought I had borne about enough of this kind\\nof talk, I threatened to make Harris tramp back to the summit and make a\\nreport on that scenery, and this suggestion spiked his battery.\\n\\nWe drove sullenly through Brienz, dead to the seductions of its\\nbewildering array of Swiss carvings and the clamorous _hoo_-hooing of\\nits cuckoo clocks, and had not entirely recovered our spirits when we\\nrattled across a bridge over the rushing blue river and entered the\\npretty town of Interlaken. It was just about sunset, and we had made the\\ntrip from Lucerne in ten hours.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII\\n\\n[The Jungfrau, the Bride, and the Piano]\\n\\nWe located ourselves at the Jungfrau Hotel, one of those huge\\nestablishments which the needs of modern travel have created in every\\nattractive spot on the continent. There was a great gathering at dinner,\\nand, as usual, one heard all sorts of languages.\\n\\nThe table d\\'hte was served by waitresses dressed in the quaint and\\ncomely costume of the Swiss peasants. This consists of a simple gros de\\nlaine, trimmed with ashes of roses, with overskirt of scare bleu ventre\\nsaint gris, cut bias on the off-side, with facings of petit polonaise\\nand narrow insertions of pte de foie gras backstitched to the mise\\nen sce`ne in the form of a jeu d\\'esprit. It gives to the wearer a\\nsingularly piquant and alluring aspect.\\n\\nOne of these waitresses, a woman of forty, had side-whiskers reaching\\nhalf-way down her jaws. They were two fingers broad, dark in color,\\npretty thick, and the hairs were an inch long. One sees many women on\\nthe continent with quite conspicuous mustaches, but this was the only\\nwoman I saw who had reached the dignity of whiskers.\\n\\nAfter dinner the guests of both sexes distributed themselves about the\\nfront porches and the ornamental grounds belonging to the hotel, to\\nenjoy the cool air; but, as the twilight deepened toward darkness, they\\ngathered themselves together in that saddest and solemnest and most\\nconstrained of all places, the great blank drawing-room which is the\\nchief feature of all continental summer hotels. There they grouped\\nthemselves about, in couples and threes, and mumbled in bated voices,\\nand looked timid and homeless and forlorn.\\n\\nThere was a small piano in this room, a clattery, wheezy, asthmatic\\nthing, certainly the very worst miscarriage in the way of a piano that\\nthe world has seen. In turn, five or six dejected and homesick ladies\\napproached it doubtingly, gave it a single inquiring thump, and\\nretired with the lockjaw. But the boss of that instrument was to come,\\nnevertheless; and from my own country--from Arkansaw.\\n\\nShe was a brand-new bride, innocent, girlish, happy in herself and her\\ngrave and worshiping stripling of a husband; she was about eighteen,\\njust out of school, free from affectations, unconscious of that\\npassionless multitude around her; and the very first time she smote\\nthat old wreck one recognized that it had met its destiny. Her stripling\\nbrought an armful of aged sheet-music from their room--for this bride\\nwent \"heeled,\" as you might say--and bent himself lovingly over and got\\nready to turn the pages.\\n\\nThe bride fetched a swoop with her fingers from one end of the keyboard\\nto the other, just to get her bearings, as it were, and you could see\\nthe congregation set their teeth with the agony of it. Then, without\\nany more preliminaries, she turned on all the horrors of the \"Battle of\\nPrague,\" that venerable shivaree, and waded chin-deep in the blood of\\nthe slain. She made a fair and honorable average of two false notes in\\nevery five, but her soul was in arms and she never stopped to correct.\\nThe audience stood it with pretty fair grit for a while, but when the\\ncannonade waxed hotter and fiercer, and the discord average rose to\\nfour in five, the procession began to move. A few stragglers held their\\nground ten minutes longer, but when the girl began to wring the true\\ninwardness out of the \"cries of the wounded,\" they struck their colors\\nand retired in a kind of panic.\\n\\nThere never was a completer victory; I was the only non-combatant left\\non the field. I would not have deserted my countrywoman anyhow, but\\nindeed I had no desires in that direction. None of us like mediocrity,\\nbut we all reverence perfection. This girl\\'s music was perfection in its\\nway; it was the worst music that had ever been achieved on our planet by\\na mere human being.\\n\\nI moved up close, and never lost a strain. When she got through, I\\nasked her to play it again. She did it with a pleased alacrity and a\\nheightened enthusiasm. She made it _all_ discords, this time. She got an\\namount of anguish into the cries of the wounded that shed a new light on\\nhuman suffering. She was on the war-path all the evening. All the time,\\ncrowds of people gathered on the porches and pressed their noses against\\nthe windows to look and marvel, but the bravest never ventured in.\\nThe bride went off satisfied and happy with her young fellow, when her\\nappetite was finally gorged, and the tourists swarmed in again.\\n\\nWhat a change has come over Switzerland, and in fact all Europe, during\\nthis century! Seventy or eighty years ago Napoleon was the only man in\\nEurope who could really be called a traveler; he was the only man who\\nhad devoted his attention to it and taken a powerful interest in it; he\\nwas the only man who had traveled extensively; but now everybody goes\\neverywhere; and Switzerland, and many other regions which were unvisited\\nand unknown remotenesses a hundred years ago, are in our days a buzzing\\nhive of restless strangers every summer. But I digress.\\n\\nIn the morning, when we looked out of our windows, we saw a wonderful\\nsight. Across the valley, and apparently quite neighborly and close at\\nhand, the giant form of the Jungfrau rose cold and white into the clear\\nsky, beyond a gateway in the nearer highlands. It reminded me, somehow,\\nof one of those colossal billows which swells suddenly up beside one\\'s\\nship, at sea, sometimes, with its crest and shoulders snowy white, and\\nthe rest of its noble proportions streaked downward with creamy foam.\\n\\nI took out my sketch-book and made a little picture of the Jungfrau,\\nmerely to get the shape.\\n\\nI do not regard this as one of my finished works, in fact I do not rank\\nit among my Works at all; it is only a study; it is hardly more than\\nwhat one might call a sketch. Other artists have done me the grace to\\nadmire it; but I am severe in my judgments of my own pictures, and this\\none does not move me.\\n\\nIt was hard to believe that that lofty wooded rampart on the left which\\nso overtops the Jungfrau was not actually the higher of the two, but it\\nwas not, of course. It is only two or three thousand feet high, and of\\ncourse has no snow upon it in summer, whereas the Jungfrau is not much\\nshorter of fourteen thousand feet high and therefore that lowest verge\\nof snow on her side, which seems nearly down to the valley level, is\\nreally about seven thousand feet higher up in the air than the summit\\nof that wooded rampart. It is the distance that makes the deception.\\nThe wooded height is but four or five miles removed from us, but the\\nJungfrau is four or five times that distance away.\\n\\nWalking down the street of shops, in the fore-noon, I was attracted by\\na large picture, carved, frame and all, from a single block of\\nchocolate-colored wood. There are people who know everything. Some of\\nthese had told us that continental shopkeepers always raise their prices\\non English and Americans. Many people had told us it was expensive to\\nbuy things through a courier, whereas I had supposed it was just the\\nreverse. When I saw this picture, I conjectured that it was worth more\\nthan the friend I proposed to buy it for would like to pay, but still it\\nwas worth while to inquire; so I told the courier to step in and ask\\nthe price, as if he wanted it for himself; I told him not to speak in\\nEnglish, and above all not to reveal the fact that he was a courier.\\nThen I moved on a few yards, and waited.\\n\\nThe courier came presently and reported the price. I said to myself, \"It\\nis a hundred francs too much,\" and so dismissed the matter from my\\nmind. But in the afternoon I was passing that place with Harris, and the\\npicture attracted me again. We stepped in, to see how much higher\\nbroken German would raise the price. The shopwoman named a figure just\\na hundred francs lower than the courier had named. This was a pleasant\\nsurprise. I said I would take it. After I had given directions as to\\nwhere it was to be shipped, the shopwoman said, appealingly:\\n\\n\"If you please, do not let your courier know you bought it.\"\\n\\nThis was an unexpected remark. I said:\\n\\n\"What makes you think I have a courier?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, that is very simple; he told me himself.\"\\n\\n\"He was very thoughtful. But tell me--why did you charge him more than\\nyou are charging me?\"\\n\\n\"That is very simple, also: I do not have to pay you a percentage.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I begin to see. You would have had to pay the courier a\\npercentage.\"\\n\\n\"Undoubtedly. The courier always has his percentage. In this case it\\nwould have been a hundred francs.\"\\n\\n\"Then the tradesman does not pay a part of it--the purchaser pays all of\\nit?\"\\n\\n\"There are occasions when the tradesman and the courier agree upon a\\nprice which is twice or thrice the value of the article, then the two\\ndivide, and both get a percentage.\"\\n\\n\"I see. But it seems to me that the purchaser does all the paying, even\\nthen.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, to be sure! It goes without saying.\"\\n\\n\"But I have bought this picture myself; therefore why shouldn\\'t the\\ncourier know it?\"\\n\\nThe woman exclaimed, in distress:\\n\\n\"Ah, indeed it would take all my little profit! He would come and demand\\nhis hundred francs, and I should have to pay.\"\\n\\n\"He has not done the buying. You could refuse.\"\\n\\n\"I could not dare to refuse. He would never bring travelers here again.\\nMore than that, he would denounce me to the other couriers, they would\\ndivert custom from me, and my business would be injured.\"\\n\\nI went away in a thoughtful frame of mind. I began to see why a courier\\ncould afford to work for fifty-five dollars a month and his fares. A\\nmonth or two later I was able to understand why a courier did not have\\nto pay any board and lodging, and why my hotel bills were always larger\\nwhen I had him with me than when I left him behind, somewhere, for a few\\ndays.\\n\\nAnother thing was also explained, now, apparently. In one town I had\\ntaken the courier to the bank to do the translating when I drew some\\nmoney. I had sat in the reading-room till the transaction was finished.\\nThen a clerk had brought the money to me in person, and had been\\nexceedingly polite, even going so far as to precede me to the door and\\nholding it open for me and bow me out as if I had been a distinguished\\npersonage. It was a new experience. Exchange had been in my favor ever\\nsince I had been in Europe, but just that one time. I got simply the\\nface of my draft, and no extra francs, whereas I had expected to get\\nquite a number of them. This was the first time I had ever used the\\ncourier at the bank. I had suspected something then, and as long as he\\nremained with me afterward I managed bank matters by myself.\\n\\nStill, if I felt that I could afford the tax, I would never travel\\nwithout a courier, for a good courier is a convenience whose value\\ncannot be estimated in dollars and cents. Without him, travel is a\\nbitter harassment, a purgatory of little exasperating annoyances, a\\nceaseless and pitiless punishment--I mean to an irascible man who has no\\nbusiness capacity and is confused by details.\\n\\nWithout a courier, travel hasn\\'t a ray of pleasure in it, anywhere; but\\nwith him it is a continuous and unruffled delight. He is always at hand,\\nnever has to be sent for; if your bell is not answered promptly--and it\\nseldom is--you have only to open the door and speak, the courier will\\nhear, and he will have the order attended to or raise an insurrection.\\nYou tell him what day you will start, and whither you are going--leave\\nall the rest to him. You need not inquire about trains, or fares, or car\\nchanges, or hotels, or anything else. At the proper time he will put you\\nin a cab or an omnibus, and drive you to the train or the boat; he has\\npacked your luggage and transferred it, he has paid all the bills. Other\\npeople have preceded you half an hour to scramble for impossible places\\nand lose their tempers, but you can take your time; the courier has\\nsecured your seats for you, and you can occupy them at your leisure.\\n\\nAt the station, the crowd mash one another to pulp in the effort to get\\nthe weigher\\'s attention to their trunks; they dispute hotly with these\\ntyrants, who are cool and indifferent; they get their baggage billets,\\nat last, and then have another squeeze and another rage over the\\ndisheartening business of trying to get them recorded and paid for, and\\nstill another over the equally disheartening business of trying to get\\nnear enough to the ticket office to buy a ticket; and now, with their\\ntempers gone to the dogs, they must stand penned up and packed together,\\nladen with wraps and satchels and shawl-straps, with the weary wife and\\nbabies, in the waiting-room, till the doors are thrown open--and then\\nall hands make a grand final rush to the train, find it full, and have\\nto stand on the platform and fret until some more cars are put on. They\\nare in a condition to kill somebody by this time. Meantime, you have\\nbeen sitting in your car, smoking, and observing all this misery in the\\nextremest comfort.\\n\\nOn the journey the guard is polite and watchful--won\\'t allow anybody to\\nget into your compartment--tells them you are just recovering from the\\nsmall-pox and do not like to be disturbed. For the courier has made\\neverything right with the guard. At way-stations the courier comes to\\nyour compartment to see if you want a glass of water, or a newspaper,\\nor anything; at eating-stations he sends luncheon out to you, while the\\nother people scramble and worry in the dining-rooms. If anything breaks\\nabout the car you are in, and a station-master proposes to pack you and\\nyour agent into a compartment with strangers, the courier reveals to him\\nconfidentially that you are a French duke born deaf and dumb, and the\\nofficial comes and makes affable signs that he has ordered a choice car\\nto be added to the train for you.\\n\\nAt custom-houses the multitude file tediously through, hot and\\nirritated, and look on while the officers burrow into the trunks and\\nmake a mess of everything; but you hand your keys to the courier and sit\\nstill. Perhaps you arrive at your destination in a rain-storm at ten\\nat night--you generally do. The multitude spend half an hour verifying\\ntheir baggage and getting it transferred to the omnibuses; but the\\ncourier puts you into a vehicle without a moment\\'s loss of time, and\\nwhen you reach your hotel you find your rooms have been secured two or\\nthree days in advance, everything is ready, you can go at once to bed.\\nSome of those other people will have to drift around to two or three\\nhotels, in the rain, before they find accommodations.\\n\\nI have not set down half of the virtues that are vested in a good\\ncourier, but I think I have set down a sufficiency of them to show that\\nan irritable man who can afford one and does not employ him is not a\\nwise economist. My courier was the worst one in Europe, yet he was a\\ngood deal better than none at all. It could not pay him to be a better\\none than he was, because I could not afford to buy things through him.\\nHe was a good enough courier for the small amount he got out of his\\nservice. Yes, to travel with a courier is bliss, to travel without one\\nis the reverse.\\n\\nI have had dealings with some very bad couriers; but I have also had\\ndealings with one who might fairly be called perfection. He was a young\\nPolander, named Joseph N. Verey. He spoke eight languages, and seemed\\nto be equally at home in all of them; he was shrewd, prompt, posted,\\nand punctual; he was fertile in resources, and singularly gifted in the\\nmatter of overcoming difficulties; he not only knew how to do everything\\nin his line, but he knew the best ways and the quickest; he was handy\\nwith children and invalids; all his employer needed to do was to take\\nlife easy and leave everything to the courier. His address is, care of\\nMessrs. Gay & Son, Strand, London; he was formerly a conductor of Gay\\'s\\ntourist parties. Excellent couriers are somewhat rare; if the reader is\\nabout to travel, he will find it to his advantage to make a note of this\\none.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIII\\n\\n[We Climb Far--by Buggy]\\n\\nThe beautiful Giesbach Fall is near Interlaken, on the other side of\\nthe lake of Brienz, and is illuminated every night with those gorgeous\\ntheatrical fires whose name I cannot call just at this moment. This was\\nsaid to be a spectacle which the tourist ought by no means to miss. I\\nwas strongly tempted, but I could not go there with propriety, because\\none goes in a boat. The task which I had set myself was to walk over\\nEurope on foot, not skim over it in a boat. I had made a tacit contract\\nwith myself; it was my duty to abide by it. I was willing to make boat\\ntrips for pleasure, but I could not conscientiously make them in the way\\nof business.\\n\\nIt cost me something of a pang to lose that fine sight, but I lived down\\nthe desire, and gained in my self-respect through the triumph. I had\\na finer and a grander sight, however, where I was. This was the mighty\\ndome of the Jungfrau softly outlined against the sky and faintly\\nsilvered by the starlight. There was something subduing in the influence\\nof that silent and solemn and awful presence; one seemed to meet the\\nimmutable, the indestructible, the eternal, face to face, and to feel\\nthe trivial and fleeting nature of his own existence the more sharply\\nby the contrast. One had the sense of being under the brooding\\ncontemplation of a spirit, not an inert mass of rocks and ice--a spirit\\nwhich had looked down, through the slow drift of the ages, upon a\\nmillion vanished races of men, and judged them; and would judge a\\nmillion more--and still be there, watching, unchanged and unchangeable,\\nafter all life should be gone and the earth have become a vacant\\ndesolation.\\n\\nWhile I was feeling these things, I was groping, without knowing it,\\ntoward an understanding of what the spell is which people find in the\\nAlps, and in no other mountains--that strange, deep, nameless influence,\\nwhich, once felt, cannot be forgotten--once felt, leaves always\\nbehind it a restless longing to feel it again--a longing which is like\\nhomesickness; a grieving, haunting yearning which will plead, implore,\\nand persecute till it has its will. I met dozens of people, imaginative\\nand unimaginative, cultivated and uncultivated, who had come from far\\ncountries and roamed through the Swiss Alps year after year--they could\\nnot explain why. They had come first, they said, out of idle curiosity,\\nbecause everybody talked about it; they had come since because they\\ncould not help it, and they should keep on coming, while they lived, for\\nthe same reason; they had tried to break their chains and stay away, but\\nit was futile; now, they had no desire to break them. Others came nearer\\nformulating what they felt; they said they could find perfect rest and\\npeace nowhere else when they were troubled: all frets and worries and\\nchafings sank to sleep in the presence of the benignant serenity of the\\nAlps; the Great Spirit of the Mountain breathed his own peace upon their\\nhurt minds and sore hearts, and healed them; they could not think base\\nthoughts or do mean and sordid things here, before the visible throne of\\nGod.\\n\\nDown the road a piece was a Kursaal--whatever that may be--and we joined\\nthe human tide to see what sort of enjoyment it might afford. It was the\\nusual open-air concert, in an ornamental garden, with wines, beer, milk,\\nwhey, grapes, etc.--the whey and the grapes being necessaries of life to\\ncertain invalids whom physicians cannot repair, and who only continue to\\nexist by the grace of whey or grapes. One of these departed spirits told\\nme, in a sad and lifeless way, that there is no way for him to live but\\nby whey, and dearly, dearly loved whey, he didn\\'t know whey he did, but\\nhe did. After making this pun he died--that is the whey it served him.\\n\\nSome other remains, preserved from decomposition by the grape system,\\ntold me that the grapes were of a peculiar breed, highly medicinal in\\ntheir nature, and that they were counted out and administered by the\\ngrape-doctors as methodically as if they were pills. The new patient,\\nif very feeble, began with one grape before breakfast, took three\\nduring breakfast, a couple between meals, five at luncheon, three in the\\nafternoon, seven at dinner, four for supper, and part of a grape just\\nbefore going to bed, by way of a general regulator. The quantity was\\ngradually and regularly increased, according to the needs and capacities\\nof the patient, until by and by you would find him disposing of his one\\ngrape per second all the day long, and his regular barrel per day.\\n\\nHe said that men cured in this way, and enabled to discard the grape\\nsystem, never afterward got over the habit of talking as if they were\\ndictating to a slow amanuensis, because they always made a pause between\\neach two words while they sucked the substance out of an imaginary\\ngrape. He said these were tedious people to talk with. He said that men\\nwho had been cured by the other process were easily distinguished from\\nthe rest of mankind because they always tilted their heads back, between\\nevery two words, and swallowed a swig of imaginary whey. He said it was\\nan impressive thing to observe two men, who had been cured by the two\\nprocesses, engaged in conversation--said their pauses and accompanying\\nmovements were so continuous and regular that a stranger would think\\nhimself in the presence of a couple of automatic machines. One finds\\nout a great many wonderful things, by traveling, if he stumbles upon the\\nright person.\\n\\nI did not remain long at the Kursaal; the music was good enough, but it\\nseemed rather tame after the cyclone of that Arkansaw expert. Besides,\\nmy adventurous spirit had conceived a formidable enterprise--nothing\\nless than a trip from Interlaken, by the Gemmi and Visp, clear to\\nZermatt, on foot! So it was necessary to plan the details, and get ready\\nfor an early start. The courier (this was not the one I have just been\\nspeaking of) thought that the portier of the hotel would be able to tell\\nus how to find our way. And so it turned out. He showed us the whole\\nthing, on a relief-map, and we could see our route, with all its\\nelevations and depressions, its villages and its rivers, as clearly as\\nif we were sailing over it in a balloon. A relief-map is a great thing.\\nThe portier also wrote down each day\\'s journey and the nightly hotel on\\na piece of paper, and made our course so plain that we should never be\\nable to get lost without high-priced outside help.\\n\\nI put the courier in the care of a gentleman who was going to Lausanne,\\nand then we went to bed, after laying out the walking-costumes and\\nputting them into condition for instant occupation in the morning.\\n\\nHowever, when we came down to breakfast at 8 A.M., it looked so much\\nlike rain that I hired a two-horse top-buggy for the first third of the\\njourney. For two or three hours we jogged along the level road which\\nskirts the beautiful lake of Thun, with a dim and dreamlike picture of\\nwatery expanses and spectral Alpine forms always before us, veiled in\\na mellowing mist. Then a steady downpour set in, and hid everything but\\nthe nearest objects. We kept the rain out of our faces with umbrellas,\\nand away from our bodies with the leather apron of the buggy; but the\\ndriver sat unsheltered and placidly soaked the weather in and seemed\\nto like it. We had the road to ourselves, and I never had a pleasanter\\nexcursion.\\n\\nThe weather began to clear while we were driving up a valley called the\\nKienthal, and presently a vast black cloud-bank in front of us dissolved\\naway and uncurtained the grand proportions and the soaring loftiness of\\nthe Blumis Alp. It was a sort of breath-taking surprise; for we had not\\nsupposed there was anything behind that low-hung blanket of sable cloud\\nbut level valley. What we had been mistaking for fleeting glimpses of\\nsky away aloft there, were really patches of the Blumis\\'s snowy crest\\ncaught through shredded rents in the drifting pall of vapor.\\n\\nWe dined in the inn at Frutigen, and our driver ought to have dined\\nthere, too, but he would not have had time to dine and get drunk\\nboth, so he gave his mind to making a masterpiece of the latter, and\\nsucceeded. A German gentleman and his two young-lady daughters had been\\ntaking their nooning at the inn, and when they left, just ahead of us,\\nit was plain that their driver was as drunk as ours, and as happy\\nand good-natured, too, which was saying a good deal. These rascals\\noverflowed with attentions and information for their guests, and with\\nbrotherly love for each other. They tied their reins, and took off\\ntheir coats and hats, so that they might be able to give unencumbered\\nattention to conversation and to the gestures necessary for its\\nillustration.\\n\\nThe road was smooth; it led up and over and down a continual succession\\nof hills; but it was narrow, the horses were used to it, and could\\nnot well get out of it anyhow; so why shouldn\\'t the drivers entertain\\nthemselves and us? The noses of our horses projected sociably into the\\nrear of the forward carriage, and as we toiled up the long hills our\\ndriver stood up and talked to his friend, and his friend stood up and\\ntalked back to him, with his rear to the scenery. When the top was\\nreached and we went flying down the other side, there was no change\\nin the program. I carry in my memory yet the picture of that forward\\ndriver, on his knees on his high seat, resting his elbows on its back,\\nand beaming down on his passengers, with happy eye, and flying hair, and\\njolly red face, and offering his card to the old German gentleman while\\nhe praised his hack and horses, and both teams were whizzing down a\\nlong hill with nobody in a position to tell whether we were bound to\\ndestruction or an undeserved safety.\\n\\nToward sunset we entered a beautiful green valley dotted with chalets, a\\ncozy little domain hidden away from the busy world in a cloistered nook\\namong giant precipices topped with snowy peaks that seemed to float like\\nislands above the curling surf of the sea of vapor that severed them\\nfrom the lower world. Down from vague and vaporous heights, little\\nruffled zigzag milky currents came crawling, and found their way to the\\nverge of one of those tremendous overhanging walls, whence they plunged,\\na shaft of silver, shivered to atoms in mid-descent and turned to an air\\npuff of luminous dust. Here and there, in grooved depressions among the\\nsnowy desolations of the upper altitudes, one glimpsed the extremity of\\na glacier, with its sea-green and honeycombed battlements of ice.\\n\\nUp the valley, under a dizzy precipice, nestled the village of\\nKandersteg, our halting-place for the night. We were soon there, and\\nhoused in the hotel. But the waning day had such an inviting influence\\nthat we did not remain housed many moments, but struck out and followed\\na roaring torrent of ice-water up to its far source in a sort of little\\ngrass-carpeted parlor, walled in all around by vast precipices and\\noverlooked by clustering summits of ice. This was the snuggest little\\ncroquet-ground imaginable; it was perfectly level, and not more than a\\nmile long by half a mile wide. The walls around it were so gigantic, and\\neverything about it was on so mighty a scale that it was belittled, by\\ncontrast, to what I have likened it to--a cozy and carpeted parlor. It\\nwas so high above the Kandersteg valley that there was nothing between\\nit and the snowy-peaks. I had never been in such intimate relations with\\nthe high altitudes before; the snow-peaks had always been remote and\\nunapproachable grandeurs, hitherto, but now we were hob-a-nob--if one\\nmay use such a seemingly irreverent expression about creations so august\\nas these.\\n\\nWe could see the streams which fed the torrent we had followed issuing\\nfrom under the greenish ramparts of glaciers; but two or three of these,\\ninstead of flowing over the precipices, sank down into the rock and\\nsprang in big jets out of holes in the mid-face of the walls.\\n\\nThe green nook which I have been describing is called the Gasternthal.\\nThe glacier streams gather and flow through it in a broad and rushing\\nbrook to a narrow cleft between lofty precipices; here the rushing\\nbrook becomes a mad torrent and goes booming and thundering down\\ntoward Kandersteg, lashing and thrashing its way over and among monster\\nboulders, and hurling chance roots and logs about like straws. There\\nwas no lack of cascades along this route. The path by the side of\\nthe torrent was so narrow that one had to look sharp, when he heard a\\ncow-bell, and hunt for a place that was wide enough to accommodate a cow\\nand a Christian side by side, and such places were not always to be had\\nat an instant\\'s notice. The cows wear church-bells, and that is a\\ngood idea in the cows, for where that torrent is, you couldn\\'t hear\\nan ordinary cow-bell any further than you could hear the ticking of a\\nwatch.\\n\\nI needed exercise, so I employed my agent in setting stranded logs and\\ndead trees adrift, and I sat on a boulder and watched them go whirling\\nand leaping head over heels down the boiling torrent. It was a\\nwonderfully exhilarating spectacle. When I had had enough exercise, I\\nmade the agent take some, by running a race with one of those logs. I\\nmade a trifle by betting on the log.\\n\\nAfter dinner we had a walk up and down the Kandersteg valley, in the\\nsoft gloaming, with the spectacle of the dying lights of day playing\\nabout the crests and pinnacles of the still and solemn upper realm\\nfor contrast, and text for talk. There were no sounds but the dulled\\ncomplaining of the torrent and the occasional tinkling of a distant\\nbell. The spirit of the place was a sense of deep, pervading peace; one\\nmight dream his life tranquilly away there, and not miss it or mind it\\nwhen it was gone.\\n\\nThe summer departed with the sun, and winter came with the stars. It\\ngrew to be a bitter night in that little hotel, backed up against a\\nprecipice that had no visible top to it, but we kept warm, and woke in\\ntime in the morning to find that everybody else had left for Gemmi\\nthree hours before--so our little plan of helping that German family\\n(principally the old man) over the pass, was a blocked generosity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIV\\n\\n[The World\\'s Highest Pig Farm]\\n\\nWe hired the only guide left, to lead us on our way. He was over\\nseventy, but he could have given me nine-tenths of his strength and\\nstill had all his age entitled him to. He shouldered our satchels,\\novercoats, and alpenstocks, and we set out up the steep path. It was hot\\nwork. The old man soon begged us to hand over our coats and waistcoats\\nto him to carry, too, and we did it; one could not refuse so little a\\nthing to a poor old man like that; he should have had them if he had\\nbeen a hundred and fifty.\\n\\nWhen we began that ascent, we could see a microscopic chalet perched\\naway up against heaven on what seemed to be the highest mountain near\\nus. It was on our right, across the narrow head of the valley. But when\\nwe got up abreast it on its own level, mountains were towering high\\nabove on every hand, and we saw that its altitude was just about that of\\nthe little Gasternthal which we had visited the evening before. Still it\\nseemed a long way up in the air, in that waste and lonely wilderness of\\nrocks. It had an unfenced grass-plot in front of it which seemed about\\nas big as a billiard-table, and this grass-plot slanted so sharply\\ndownward, and was so brief, and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge\\nof the absolute precipice, that it was a shuddery thing to think of a\\nperson\\'s venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated at all.\\nSuppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard; there would be\\nnothing for him to seize; nothing could keep him from rolling; five\\nrevolutions would bring him to the edge, and over he would go.\\n\\nWhat a frightful distance he would fall!--for there are very few birds\\nthat fly as high as his starting-point. He would strike and bounce, two\\nor three times, on his way down, but this would be no advantage to him.\\nI would as soon take an airing on the slant of a rainbow as in such\\na front yard. I would rather, in fact, for the distance down would be\\nabout the same, and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce. I could\\nnot see how the peasants got up to that chalet--the region seemed too\\nsteep for anything but a balloon.\\n\\nAs we strolled on, climbing up higher and higher, we were continually\\nbringing neighboring peaks into view and lofty prominence which had been\\nhidden behind lower peaks before; so by and by, while standing before a\\ngroup of these giants, we looked around for the chalet again; there it\\nwas, away down below us, apparently on an inconspicuous ridge in the\\nvalley! It was as far below us, now, as it had been above us when we\\nwere beginning the ascent.\\n\\nAfter a while the path led us along a railed precipice, and we looked\\nover--far beneath us was the snug parlor again, the little Gasternthal,\\nwith its water jets spouting from the face of its rock walls. We could\\nhave dropped a stone into it. We had been finding the top of the world\\nall along--and always finding a still higher top stealing into view in\\na disappointing way just ahead; when we looked down into the Gasternthal\\nwe felt pretty sure that we had reached the genuine top at last, but it\\nwas not so; there were much higher altitudes to be scaled yet. We were\\nstill in the pleasant shade of forest trees, we were still in a region\\nwhich was cushioned with beautiful mosses and aglow with the many-tinted\\nluster of innumerable wild flowers.\\n\\nWe found, indeed, more interest in the wild flowers than in anything\\nelse. We gathered a specimen or two of every kind which we were\\nunacquainted with; so we had sumptuous bouquets. But one of the chief\\ninterests lay in chasing the seasons of the year up the mountain, and\\ndetermining them by the presence of flowers and berries which we were\\nacquainted with. For instance, it was the end of August at the level\\nof the sea; in the Kandersteg valley at the base of the pass, we found\\nflowers which would not be due at the sea-level for two or three weeks;\\nhigher up, we entered October, and gathered fringed gentians. I made\\nno notes, and have forgotten the details, but the construction of the\\nfloral calendar was very entertaining while it lasted.\\n\\nIn the high regions we found rich store of the splendid red flower\\ncalled the Alpine rose, but we did not find any examples of the ugly\\nSwiss favorite called Edelweiss. Its name seems to indicate that it is a\\nnoble flower and that it is white. It may be noble enough, but it is not\\nattractive, and it is not white. The fuzzy blossom is the color of bad\\ncigar ashes, and appears to be made of a cheap quality of gray plush. It\\nhas a noble and distant way of confining itself to the high altitudes,\\nbut that is probably on account of its looks; it apparently has no\\nmonopoly of those upper altitudes, however, for they are sometimes\\nintruded upon by some of the loveliest of the valley families of wild\\nflowers. Everybody in the Alps wears a sprig of Edelweiss in his hat. It\\nis the native\\'s pet, and also the tourist\\'s.\\n\\nAll the morning, as we loafed along, having a good time, other\\npedestrians went staving by us with vigorous strides, and with the\\nintent and determined look of men who were walking for a wager. These\\nwore loose knee-breeches, long yarn stockings, and hobnailed high-laced\\nwalking-shoes. They were gentlemen who would go home to England or\\nGermany and tell how many miles they had beaten the guide-book every\\nday. But I doubted if they ever had much real fun, outside of the mere\\nmagnificent exhilaration of the tramp through the green valleys and the\\nbreezy heights; for they were almost always alone, and even the finest\\nscenery loses incalculably when there is no one to enjoy it with.\\n\\nAll the morning an endless double procession of mule-mounted tourists\\nfiled past us along the narrow path--the one procession going, the\\nother coming. We had taken a good deal of trouble to teach ourselves the\\nkindly German custom of saluting all strangers with doffed hat, and we\\nresolutely clung to it, that morning, although it kept us bareheaded\\nmost of the time and was not always responded to. Still we found an\\ninterest in the thing, because we naturally liked to know who were\\nEnglish and Americans among the passers-by. All continental natives\\nresponded of course; so did some of the English and Americans, but, as\\na general thing, these two races gave no sign. Whenever a man or a woman\\nshowed us cold neglect, we spoke up confidently in our own tongue and\\nasked for such information as we happened to need, and we always got a\\nreply in the same language. The English and American folk are not less\\nkindly than other races, they are only more reserved, and that comes of\\nhabit and education. In one dreary, rocky waste, away above the line of\\nvegetation, we met a procession of twenty-five mounted young men, all\\nfrom America. We got answering bows enough from these, of course, for\\nthey were of an age to learn to do in Rome as Rome does, without much\\neffort.\\n\\nAt one extremity of this patch of desolation, overhung by bare and\\nforbidding crags which husbanded drifts of everlasting snow in their\\nshaded cavities, was a small stretch of thin and discouraged grass, and\\na man and a family of pigs were actually living here in some shanties.\\nConsequently this place could be really reckoned as \"property\"; it had\\na money value, and was doubtless taxed. I think it must have marked\\nthe limit of real estate in this world. It would be hard to set a money\\nvalue upon any piece of earth that lies between that spot and the empty\\nrealm of space. That man may claim the distinction of owning the end\\nof the world, for if there is any definite end to the world he has\\ncertainly found it.\\n\\nFrom here forward we moved through a storm-swept and smileless\\ndesolation. All about us rose gigantic masses, crags, and ramparts of\\nbare and dreary rock, with not a vestige or semblance of plant or tree\\nor flower anywhere, or glimpse of any creature that had life. The frost\\nand the tempests of unnumbered ages had battered and hacked at these\\ncliffs, with a deathless energy, destroying them piecemeal; so all the\\nregion about their bases was a tumbled chaos of great fragments which\\nhad been split off and hurled to the ground. Soiled and aged banks of\\nsnow lay close about our path. The ghastly desolation of the place was\\nas tremendously complete as if Dor had furnished the working-plans\\nfor it. But every now and then, through the stern gateways around us\\nwe caught a view of some neighboring majestic dome, sheathed with\\nglittering ice, and displaying its white purity at an elevation compared\\nto which ours was groveling and plebeian, and this spectacle always\\nchained one\\'s interest and admiration at once, and made him forget there\\nwas anything ugly in the world.\\n\\nI have just said that there was nothing but death and desolation in\\nthese hideous places, but I forgot. In the most forlorn and arid and\\ndismal one of all, where the racked and splintered debris was thickest,\\nwhere the ancient patches of snow lay against the very path, where\\nthe winds blew bitterest and the general aspect was mournfulest and\\ndreariest, and furthest from any suggestion of cheer or hope, I found\\na solitary wee forget-me-not flourishing away, not a droop about it\\nanywhere, but holding its bright blue star up with the prettiest and\\ngallantest air in the world, the only happy spirit, the only smiling\\nthing, in all that grisly desert. She seemed to say, \"Cheer up!--as long\\nas we are here, let us make the best of it.\" I judged she had earned a\\nright to a more hospitable place; so I plucked her up and sent her to\\nAmerica to a friend who would respect her for the fight she had made,\\nall by her small self, to make a whole vast despondent Alpine desolation\\nstop breaking its heart over the unalterable, and hold up its head and\\nlook at the bright side of things for once.\\n\\nWe stopped for a nooning at a strongly built little inn called the\\nSchwarenbach. It sits in a lonely spot among the peaks, where it is\\nswept by the trailing fringes of the cloud-rack, and is rained on, and\\nsnowed on, and pelted and persecuted by the storms, nearly every day of\\nits life. It was the only habitation in the whole Gemmi Pass.\\n\\nClose at hand, now, was a chance for a blood-curdling Alpine adventure.\\nClose at hand was the snowy mass of the Great Altels cooling its topknot\\nin the sky and daring us to an ascent. I was fired with the idea, and\\nimmediately made up my mind to procure the necessary guides, ropes,\\netc., and undertake it. I instructed Harris to go to the landlord of the\\ninn and set him about our preparations. Meantime, I went diligently to\\nwork to read up and find out what this much-talked-of mountain-climbing\\nwas like, and how one should go about it--for in these matters I was\\nignorant. I opened Mr. Hinchliff\\'s _Summer Months Among The Alps_\\n(published 1857), and selected his account of his ascent of Monte Rosa.\\n\\nIt began:\\n\\n\"It is very difficult to free the mind from excitement on the evening\\nbefore a grand expedition--\"\\n\\nI saw that I was too calm; so I walked the room a while and worked\\nmyself into a high excitement; but the book\\'s next remark--that the\\nadventurer must get up at two in the morning--came as near as anything\\nto flatting it all out again. However, I reinforced it, and read on,\\nabout how Mr. Hinchliff dressed by candle-light and was \"soon down among\\nthe guides, who were bustling about in the passage, packing provisions,\\nand making every preparation for the start\"; and how he glanced out into\\nthe cold clear night and saw that--\\n\\n\"The whole sky was blazing with stars, larger and brighter than they\\nappear through the dense atmosphere breathed by inhabitants of the lower\\nparts of the earth. They seemed actually suspended from the dark vault\\nof heaven, and their gentle light shed a fairylike gleam over the\\nsnow-fields around the foot of the Matterhorn, which raised its\\nstupendous pinnacle on high, penetrating to the heart of the Great Bear,\\nand crowning itself with a diadem of his magnificent stars. Not a sound\\ndisturbed the deep tranquillity of the night, except the distant roar\\nof streams which rush from the high plateau of the St. Theodule glacier,\\nand fall headlong over precipitous rocks till they lose themselves in\\nthe mazes of the Gorner glacier.\"\\n\\nHe took his hot toast and coffee, and then about half past three his\\ncaravan of ten men filed away from the Riffel Hotel, and began the steep\\nclimb. At half past five he happened to turn around, and \"beheld the\\nglorious spectacle of the Matterhorn, just touched by the rosy-fingered\\nmorning, and looking like a huge pyramid of fire rising out of the\\nbarren ocean of ice and rock around it.\" Then the Breithorn and the Dent\\nBlanche caught the radiant glow; but \"the intervening mass of Monte Rosa\\nmade it necessary for us to climb many long hours before we could hope\\nto see the sun himself, yet the whole air soon grew warmer after the\\nsplendid birth of the day.\"\\n\\nHe gazed at the lofty crown of Monte Rosa and the wastes of snow that\\nguarded its steep approaches, and the chief guide delivered the opinion\\nthat no man could conquer their awful heights and put his foot upon that\\nsummit. But the adventurers moved steadily on, nevertheless.\\n\\nThey toiled up, and up, and still up; they passed the Grand Plateau;\\nthen toiled up a steep shoulder of the mountain, clinging like flies to\\nits rugged face; and now they were confronted by a tremendous wall\\nfrom which great blocks of ice and snow were evidently in the habit of\\nfalling. They turned aside to skirt this wall, and gradually ascended\\nuntil their way was barred by a \"maze of gigantic snow crevices,\"--so\\nthey turned aside again, and \"began a long climb of sufficient steepness\\nto make a zigzag course necessary.\"\\n\\nFatigue compelled them to halt frequently, for a moment or two. At one\\nof these halts somebody called out, \"Look at Mont Blanc!\" and \"we were\\nat once made aware of the very great height we had attained by actually\\nseeing the monarch of the Alps and his attendant satellites right over\\nthe top of the Breithorn, itself at least 14,000 feet high!\"\\n\\nThese people moved in single file, and were all tied to a strong rope,\\nat regular distances apart, so that if one of them slipped on those\\ngiddy heights, the others could brace themselves on their alpenstocks\\nand save him from darting into the valley, thousands of feet below. By\\nand by they came to an ice-coated ridge which was tilted up at a sharp\\nangle, and had a precipice on one side of it. They had to climb this, so\\nthe guide in the lead cut steps in the ice with his hatchet, and as fast\\nas he took his toes out of one of these slight holes, the toes of the\\nman behind him occupied it.\\n\\n\"Slowly and steadily we kept on our way over this dangerous part of the\\nascent, and I dare say it was fortunate for some of us that attention\\nwas distracted from the head by the paramount necessity of looking after\\nthe feet; _for, while on the left the incline of ice was so steep that\\nit would be impossible for any man to save himself in case of a slip,\\nunless the others could hold him up, on the right we might drop a pebble\\nfrom the hand over precipices of unknown extent down upon the tremendous\\nglacier below._\\n\\n\"Great caution, therefore, was absolutely necessary, and in this exposed\\nsituation we were attacked by all the fury of that grand enemy of\\naspirants to Monte Rosa--a severe and bitterly cold wind from the north.\\nThe fine powdery snow was driven past us in the clouds, penetrating the\\ninterstices of our clothes, and the pieces of ice which flew from the\\nblows of Peter\\'s ax were whisked into the air, and then dashed over the\\nprecipice. We had quite enough to do to prevent ourselves from being\\nserved in the same ruthless fashion, and now and then, in the more\\nviolent gusts of wind, were glad to stick our alpenstocks into the ice\\nand hold on hard.\"\\n\\nHaving surmounted this perilous steep, they sat down and took a brief\\nrest with their backs against a sheltering rock and their heels dangling\\nover a bottomless abyss; then they climbed to the base of another\\nridge--a more difficult and dangerous one still:\\n\\n\"The whole of the ridge was exceedingly narrow, and the fall on each\\nside desperately steep, but the ice in some of these intervals between\\nthe masses of rock assumed the form of a mere sharp edge, almost like a\\nknife; these places, though not more than three or four short paces\\nin length, looked uncommonly awkward; but, like the sword leading true\\nbelievers to the gates of Paradise, they must needs be passed before\\nwe could attain to the summit of our ambition. These were in one or two\\nplaces so narrow, that in stepping over them with toes well turned out\\nfor greater security, _one end of the foot projected over the awful\\nprecipice on the right, while the other was on the beginning of the ice\\nslope on the left, which was scarcely less steep than the rocks._ On\\nthese occasions Peter would take my hand, and each of us stretching as\\nfar as we could, he was thus enabled to get a firm footing two paces\\nor rather more from me, whence a spring would probably bring him to the\\nrock on the other side; then, turning around, he called to me to come,\\nand, taking a couple of steps carefully, I was met at the third by his\\noutstretched hand ready to clasp mine, and in a moment stood by his\\nside. The others followed in much the same fashion. Once my right foot\\nslipped on the side toward the precipice, but I threw out my left arm in\\na moment so that it caught the icy edge under my armpit as I fell, and\\nsupported me considerably; at the same instant I cast my eyes down the\\nside on which I had slipped, and contrived to plant my right foot on\\na piece of rock as large as a cricket-ball, which chanced to protrude\\nthrough the ice, on the very edge of the precipice. Being thus anchored\\nfore and aft, as it were, I believe I could easily have recovered\\nmyself, even if I had been alone, though it must be confessed the\\nsituation would have been an awful one; as it was, however, a jerk from\\nPeter settled the matter very soon, and I was on my legs all right in an\\ninstant. The rope is an immense help in places of this kind.\"\\n\\nNow they arrived at the base of a great knob or dome veneered with ice\\nand powdered with snow--the utmost, summit, the last bit of solidity\\nbetween them and the hollow vault of heaven. They set to work with their\\nhatchets, and were soon creeping, insectlike, up its surface, with their\\nheels projecting over the thinnest kind of nothingness, thickened up a\\nlittle with a few wandering shreds and films of cloud moving in a lazy\\nprocession far below. Presently, one man\\'s toe-hold broke and he fell!\\nThere he dangled in mid-air at the end of the rope, like a spider, till\\nhis friends above hauled him into place again.\\n\\nA little bit later, the party stood upon the wee pedestal of the very\\nsummit, in a driving wind, and looked out upon the vast green expanses\\nof Italy and a shoreless ocean of billowy Alps.\\n\\nWhen I had read thus far, Harris broke into the room in a noble\\nexcitement and said the ropes and the guides were secured, and asked if\\nI was ready. I said I believed I wouldn\\'t ascend the Altels this time. I\\nsaid Alp-climbing was a different thing from what I had supposed it was,\\nand so I judged we had better study its points a little more before we\\nwent definitely into it. But I told him to retain the guides and order\\nthem to follow us to Zermatt, because I meant to use them there. I said\\nI could feel the spirit of adventure beginning to stir in me, and was\\nsure that the fell fascination of Alp-climbing would soon be upon me. I\\nsaid he could make up his mind to it that we would do a deed before\\nwe were a week older which would make the hair of the timid curl with\\nfright.\\n\\nThis made Harris happy, and filled him with ambitious anticipations. He\\nwent at once to tell the guides to follow us to Zermatt and bring all\\ntheir paraphernalia with them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV\\n\\n[Swindling the Coroner]\\n\\nA great and priceless thing is a new interest! How it takes possession\\nof a man! how it clings to him, how it rides him! I strode onward from\\nthe Schwarenbach hostelry a changed man, a reorganized personality. I\\nwalked into a new world, I saw with new eyes. I had been looking\\naloft at the giant show-peaks only as things to be worshiped for their\\ngrandeur and magnitude, and their unspeakable grace of form; I looked\\nup at them now, as also things to be conquered and climbed. My sense of\\ntheir grandeur and their noble beauty was neither lost nor impaired; I\\nhad gained a new interest in the mountains without losing the old ones.\\nI followed the steep lines up, inch by inch, with my eye, and noted the\\npossibility or impossibility of following them with my feet. When I saw\\na shining helmet of ice projecting above the clouds, I tried to imagine\\nI saw files of black specks toiling up it roped together with a gossamer\\nthread.\\n\\nWe skirted the lonely little lake called the Daubensee, and presently\\npassed close by a glacier on the right--a thing like a great river\\nfrozen solid in its flow and broken square off like a wall at its mouth.\\nI had never been so near a glacier before.\\n\\nHere we came upon a new board shanty, and found some men engaged in\\nbuilding a stone house; so the Schwarenbach was soon to have a rival. We\\nbought a bottle or so of beer here; at any rate they called it beer, but\\nI knew by the price that it was dissolved jewelry, and I perceived by\\nthe taste that dissolved jewelry is not good stuff to drink.\\n\\nWe were surrounded by a hideous desolation. We stepped forward to a sort\\nof jumping-off place, and were confronted by a startling contrast: we\\nseemed to look down into fairyland. Two or three thousand feet below us\\nwas a bright green level, with a pretty town in its midst, and a silvery\\nstream winding among the meadows; the charming spot was walled in on all\\nsides by gigantic precipices clothed with pines; and over the pines, out\\nof the softened distances, rose the snowy domes and peaks of the Monte\\nRosa region. How exquisitely green and beautiful that little valley down\\nthere was! The distance was not great enough to obliterate details, it\\nonly made them little, and mellow, and dainty, like landscapes and towns\\nseen through the wrong end of a spy-glass.\\n\\nRight under us a narrow ledge rose up out of the valley, with a green,\\nslanting, bench-shaped top, and grouped about upon this green-baize\\nbench were a lot of black and white sheep which looked merely like\\noversized worms. The bench seemed lifted well up into our neighborhood,\\nbut that was a deception--it was a long way down to it.\\n\\nWe began our descent, now, by the most remarkable road I have ever seen.\\nIt wound its corkscrew curves down the face of the colossal precipice--a\\nnarrow way, with always the solid rock wall at one elbow, and\\nperpendicular nothingness at the other. We met an everlasting procession\\nof guides, porters, mules, litters, and tourists climbing up this steep\\nand muddy path, and there was no room to spare when you had to pass a\\ntolerably fat mule. I always took the inside, when I heard or saw the\\nmule coming, and flattened myself against the wall. I preferred the\\ninside, of course, but I should have had to take it anyhow, because\\nthe mule prefers the outside. A mule\\'s preference--on a precipice--is a\\nthing to be respected. Well, his choice is always the outside. His life\\nis mostly devoted to carrying bulky panniers and packages which rest\\nagainst his body--therefore he is habituated to taking the outside edge\\nof mountain paths, to keep his bundles from rubbing against rocks or\\nbanks on the other. When he goes into the passenger business he absurdly\\nclings to his old habit, and keeps one leg of his passenger always\\ndangling over the great deeps of the lower world while that passenger\\'s\\nheart is in the highlands, so to speak. More than once I saw a mule\\'s\\nhind foot cave over the outer edge and send earth and rubbish into the\\nbottom abyss; and I noticed that upon these occasions the rider, whether\\nmale or female, looked tolerably unwell.\\n\\nThere was one place where an eighteen-inch breadth of light masonry had\\nbeen added to the verge of the path, and as there was a very sharp\\nturn here, a panel of fencing had been set up there at some time, as\\na protection. This panel was old and gray and feeble, and the light\\nmasonry had been loosened by recent rains. A young American girl came\\nalong on a mule, and in making the turn the mule\\'s hind foot caved all\\nthe loose masonry and one of the fence-posts overboard; the mule gave a\\nviolent lurch inboard to save himself, and succeeded in the effort, but\\nthat girl turned as white as the snows of Mont Blanc for a moment.\\n\\nThe path was simply a groove cut into the face of the precipice; there\\nwas a four-foot breadth of solid rock under the traveler, and four-foot\\nbreadth of solid rock just above his head, like the roof of a narrow\\nporch; he could look out from this gallery and see a sheer summitless\\nand bottomless wall of rock before him, across a gorge or crack a\\nbiscuit\\'s toss in width--but he could not see the bottom of his own\\nprecipice unless he lay down and projected his nose over the edge. I did\\nnot do this, because I did not wish to soil my clothes.\\n\\nEvery few hundred yards, at particularly bad places, one came across\\na panel or so of plank fencing; but they were always old and weak,\\nand they generally leaned out over the chasm and did not make any rash\\npromises to hold up people who might need support. There was one of\\nthese panels which had only its upper board left; a pedestrianizing\\nEnglish youth came tearing down the path, was seized with an impulse to\\nlook over the precipice, and without an instant\\'s thought he threw his\\nweight upon that crazy board. It bent outward a foot! I never made a\\ngasp before that came so near suffocating me. The English youth\\'s face\\nsimply showed a lively surprise, but nothing more. He went swinging\\nalong valleyward again, as if he did not know he had just swindled a\\ncoroner by the closest kind of a shave.\\n\\nThe Alpine litter is sometimes like a cushioned box made fast between\\nthe middles of two long poles, and sometimes it is a chair with a back\\nto it and a support for the feet. It is carried by relays of strong\\nporters. The motion is easier than that of any other conveyance. We met\\na few men and a great many ladies in litters; it seemed to me that most\\nof the ladies looked pale and nauseated; their general aspect gave me\\nthe idea that they were patiently enduring a horrible suffering. As a\\nrule, they looked at their laps, and left the scenery to take care of\\nitself.\\n\\nBut the most frightened creature I saw, was a led horse that overtook\\nus. Poor fellow, he had been born and reared in the grassy levels of the\\nKandersteg valley and had never seen anything like this hideous place\\nbefore. Every few steps he would stop short, glance wildly out from\\nthe dizzy height, and then spread his red nostrils wide and pant as\\nviolently as if he had been running a race; and all the while he quaked\\nfrom head to heel as with a palsy. He was a handsome fellow, and he\\nmade a fine statuesque picture of terror, but it was pitiful to see him\\nsuffer so.\\n\\nThis dreadful path has had its tragedy. Baedeker, with his customary\\nover terseness, begins and ends the tale thus:\\n\\n\"The descent on horseback should be avoided. In 1861 a Comtesse\\nd\\'Herlincourt fell from her saddle over the precipice and was killed on\\nthe spot.\"\\n\\nWe looked over the precipice there, and saw the monument which\\ncommemorates the event. It stands in the bottom of the gorge, in a place\\nwhich has been hollowed out of the rock to protect it from the torrent\\nand the storms. Our old guide never spoke but when spoken to, and then\\nlimited himself to a syllable or two, but when we asked him about this\\ntragedy he showed a strong interest in the matter. He said the Countess\\nwas very pretty, and very young--hardly out of her girlhood, in fact.\\nShe was newly married, and was on her bridal tour. The young husband was\\nriding a little in advance; one guide was leading the husband\\'s horse,\\nanother was leading the bride\\'s.\\n\\nThe old man continued:\\n\\n\"The guide that was leading the husband\\'s horse happened to glance back,\\nand there was that poor young thing sitting up staring out over the\\nprecipice; and her face began to bend downward a little, and she put\\nup her two hands slowly and met it--so,--and put them flat against her\\neyes--so--and then she sank out of the saddle, with a sharp shriek, and\\none caught only the flash of a dress, and it was all over.\"\\n\\nThen after a pause:\\n\\n\"Ah, yes, that guide saw these things--yes, he saw them all. He saw them\\nall, just as I have told you.\"\\n\\nAfter another pause:\\n\\n\"Ah, yes, he saw them all. My God, that was _me_. I was that guide!\"\\n\\nThis had been the one event of the old man\\'s life; so one may be sure he\\nhad forgotten no detail connected with it. We listened to all he had to\\nsay about what was done and what happened and what was said after the\\nsorrowful occurrence, and a painful story it was.\\n\\nWhen we had wound down toward the valley until we were about on the last\\nspiral of the corkscrew, Harris\\'s hat blew over the last remaining\\nbit of precipice--a small cliff a hundred or hundred and fifty feet\\nhigh--and sailed down toward a steep slant composed of rough chips and\\nfragments which the weather had flaked away from the precipices. We went\\nleisurely down there, expecting to find it without any trouble, but we\\nhad made a mistake, as to that. We hunted during a couple of hours--not\\nbecause the old straw hat was valuable, but out of curiosity to find\\nout how such a thing could manage to conceal itself in open ground where\\nthere was nothing left for it to hide behind. When one is reading in\\nbed, and lays his paper-knife down, he cannot find it again if it is\\nsmaller than a saber; that hat was as stubborn as any paper-knife could\\nhave been, and we finally had to give it up; but we found a fragment\\nthat had once belonged to an opera-glass, and by digging around and\\nturning over the rocks we gradually collected all the lenses and the\\ncylinders and the various odds and ends that go to making up a complete\\nopera-glass. We afterward had the thing reconstructed, and the owner can\\nhave his adventurous lost-property by submitting proofs and paying costs\\nof rehabilitation. We had hopes of finding the owner there, distributed\\naround amongst the rocks, for it would have made an elegant paragraph;\\nbut we were disappointed. Still, we were far from being disheartened,\\nfor there was a considerable area which we had not thoroughly searched;\\nwe were satisfied he was there, somewhere, so we resolved to wait over a\\nday at Leuk and come back and get him.\\n\\nThen we sat down to polish off the perspiration and arrange about what\\nwe would do with him when we got him. Harris was for contributing him to\\nthe British Museum; but I was for mailing him to his widow. That is the\\ndifference between Harris and me: Harris is all for display, I am all\\nfor the simple right, even though I lose money by it. Harris argued in\\nfavor of his proposition against mine, I argued in favor of mine and\\nagainst his. The discussion warmed into a dispute; the dispute warmed\\ninto a quarrel. I finally said, very decidedly:\\n\\n\"My mind is made up. He goes to the widow.\"\\n\\nHarris answered sharply:\\n\\n\"And _my_ mind is made up. He goes to the Museum.\"\\n\\nI said, calmly:\\n\\n\"The museum may whistle when it gets him.\"\\n\\nHarris retorted:\\n\\n\"The widow may save herself the trouble of whistling, for I will see\\nthat she never gets him.\"\\n\\nAfter some angry bandying of epithets, I said:\\n\\n\"It seems to me that you are taking on a good many airs about these\\nremains. I don\\'t quite see what _you\\'ve_ got to say about them?\"\\n\\n\"I? I\\'ve got _all_ to say about them. They\\'d never have been thought of\\nif I hadn\\'t found their opera-glass. The corpse belongs to me, and I\\'ll\\ndo as I please with him.\"\\n\\nI was leader of the Expedition, and all discoveries achieved by it\\nnaturally belonged to me. I was entitled to these remains, and could\\nhave enforced my right; but rather than have bad blood about the matter,\\nI said we would toss up for them. I threw heads and won, but it was a\\nbarren victory, for although we spent all the next day searching, we\\nnever found a bone. I cannot imagine what could ever have become of that\\nfellow.\\n\\nThe town in the valley is called Leuk or Leukerbad. We pointed our\\ncourse toward it, down a verdant slope which was adorned with fringed\\ngentians and other flowers, and presently entered the narrow alleys of\\nthe outskirts and waded toward the middle of the town through liquid\\n\"fertilizer.\" They ought to either pave that village or organize a\\nferry.\\n\\nHarris\\'s body was simply a chamois-pasture; his person was populous with\\nthe little hungry pests; his skin, when he stripped, was splotched like\\na scarlet-fever patient\\'s; so, when we were about to enter one of the\\nLeukerbad inns, and he noticed its sign, \"Chamois Hotel,\" he refused to\\nstop there. He said the chamois was plentiful enough, without hunting\\nup hotels where they made a specialty of it. I was indifferent, for the\\nchamois is a creature that will neither bite me nor abide with me; but\\nto calm Harris, we went to the Htel des Alpes.\\n\\nAt the table d\\'hte, we had this, for an incident. A very grave man--in\\nfact his gravity amounted to solemnity, and almost to austerity--sat\\nopposite us and he was \"tight,\" but doing his best to appear sober. He\\ntook up a _corked_ bottle of wine, tilted it over his glass awhile,\\nthen set it out of the way, with a contented look, and went on with his\\ndinner.\\n\\nPresently he put his glass to his mouth, and of course found it empty.\\nHe looked puzzled, and glanced furtively and suspiciously out of the\\ncorner of his eye at a benignant and unconscious old lady who sat at his\\nright. Shook his head, as much as to say, \"No, she couldn\\'t have\\ndone it.\" He tilted the corked bottle over his glass again, meantime\\nsearching around with his watery eye to see if anybody was watching him.\\nHe ate a few mouthfuls, raised his glass to his lips, and of course it\\nwas still empty. He bent an injured and accusing side-glance upon that\\nunconscious old lady, which was a study to see. She went on eating and\\ngave no sign. He took up his glass and his bottle, with a wise private\\nnod of his head, and set them gravely on the left-hand side of his\\nplate--poured himself another imaginary drink--went to work with\\nhis knife and fork once more--presently lifted his glass with good\\nconfidence, and found it empty, as usual.\\n\\nThis was almost a petrifying surprise. He straightened himself up in his\\nchair and deliberately and sorrowfully inspected the busy old ladies at\\nhis elbows, first one and then the other. At last he softly pushed his\\nplate away, set his glass directly in front of him, held on to it\\nwith his left hand, and proceeded to pour with his right. This time\\nhe observed that nothing came. He turned the bottle clear upside down;\\nstill nothing issued from it; a plaintive look came into his face, and\\nhe said, as if to himself,\\n\\n\"\\'_Ic! they\\'ve got it all_!\" Then he set the bottle down, resignedly,\\nand took the rest of his dinner dry.\\n\\nIt was at that table d\\'hte, too, that I had under inspection the\\nlargest lady I have ever seen in private life. She was over seven feet\\nhigh, and magnificently proportioned. What had first called my attention\\nto her, was my stepping on an outlying flange of her foot, and hearing,\\nfrom up toward the ceiling, a deep \"Pardon, m\\'sieu, but you encroach!\"\\n\\nThat was when we were coming through the hall, and the place was dim,\\nand I could see her only vaguely. The thing which called my attention\\nto her the second time was, that at a table beyond ours were two very\\npretty girls, and this great lady came in and sat down between them and\\nme and blotted out my view. She had a handsome face, and she was very\\nfinely formed--perfectly formed, I should say. But she made everybody\\naround her look trivial and commonplace. Ladies near her looked like\\nchildren, and the men about her looked mean. They looked like failures;\\nand they looked as if they felt so, too. She sat with her back to us. I\\nnever saw such a back in my life. I would have so liked to see the\\nmoon rise over it. The whole congregation waited, under one pretext or\\nanother, till she finished her dinner and went out; they wanted to see\\nher at full altitude, and they found it worth tarrying for. She filled\\none\\'s idea of what an empress ought to be, when she rose up in her\\nunapproachable grandeur and moved superbly out of that place.\\n\\nWe were not at Leuk in time to see her at her heaviest weight. She had\\nsuffered from corpulence and had come there to get rid of her extra\\nflesh in the baths. Five weeks of soaking--five uninterrupted hours of\\nit every day--had accomplished her purpose and reduced her to the right\\nproportions.\\n\\nThose baths remove fat, and also skin-diseases. The patients remain in\\nthe great tanks for hours at a time. A dozen gentlemen and ladies occupy\\na tank together, and amuse themselves with rompings and various games.\\nThey have floating desks and tables, and they read or lunch or play\\nchess in water that is breast-deep. The tourist can step in and view\\nthis novel spectacle if he chooses. There\\'s a poor-box, and he will have\\nto contribute. There are several of these big bathing-houses, and you\\ncan always tell when you are near one of them by the romping noises and\\nshouts of laughter that proceed from it. The water is running water, and\\nchanges all the time, else a patient with a ringworm might take the bath\\nwith only a partial success, since, while he was ridding himself of the\\nringworm, he might catch the itch.\\n\\nThe next morning we wandered back up the green valley, leisurely, with\\nthe curving walls of those bare and stupendous precipices rising\\ninto the clouds before us. I had never seen a clean, bare precipice\\nstretching up five thousand feet above me before, and I never shall\\nexpect to see another one. They exist, perhaps, but not in places where\\none can easily get close to them. This pile of stone is peculiar. From\\nits base to the soaring tops of its mighty towers, all its lines and all\\nits details vaguely suggest human architecture. There are rudimentary\\nbow-windows, cornices, chimneys, demarcations of stories, etc. One could\\nsit and stare up there and study the features and exquisite graces of\\nthis grand structure, bit by bit, and day after day, and never weary his\\ninterest. The termination, toward the town, observed in profile, is the\\nperfection of shape. It comes down out of the clouds in a succession of\\nrounded, colossal, terracelike projections--a stairway for the gods; at\\nits head spring several lofty storm-scarred towers, one after another,\\nwith faint films of vapor curling always about them like spectral\\nbanners. If there were a king whose realms included the whole world,\\nhere would be the place meet and proper for such a monarch. He would\\nonly need to hollow it out and put in the electric light. He could give\\naudience to a nation at a time under its roof.\\n\\nOur search for those remains having failed, we inspected with a glass\\nthe dim and distant track of an old-time avalanche that once swept down\\nfrom some pine-grown summits behind the town and swept away the houses\\nand buried the people; then we struck down the road that leads toward\\nthe Rhone, to see the famous Ladders. These perilous things are built\\nagainst the perpendicular face of a cliff two or three hundred feet\\nhigh. The peasants, of both sexes, were climbing up and down them, with\\nheavy loads on their backs. I ordered Harris to make the ascent, so I\\ncould put the thrill and horror of it in my book, and he accomplished\\nthe feat successfully, through a subagent, for three francs, which I\\npaid. It makes me shudder yet when I think of what I felt when I was\\nclinging there between heaven and earth in the person of that proxy. At\\ntimes the world swam around me, and I could hardly keep from letting go,\\nso dizzying was the appalling danger. Many a person would have given up\\nand descended, but I stuck to my task, and would not yield until I had\\naccomplished it. I felt a just pride in my exploit, but I would not have\\nrepeated it for the wealth of the world. I shall break my neck yet with\\nsome such foolhardy performance, for warnings never seem to have any\\nlasting effect on me. When the people of the hotel found that I had\\nbeen climbing those crazy Ladders, it made me an object of considerable\\nattention.\\n\\nNext morning, early, we drove to the Rhone valley and took the train for\\nVisp. There we shouldered our knapsacks and things, and set out on foot,\\nin a tremendous rain, up the winding gorge, toward Zermatt. Hour after\\nhour we slopped along, by the roaring torrent, and under noble Lesser\\nAlps which were clothed in rich velvety green all the way up and\\nhad little atomy Swiss homes perched upon grassy benches along their\\nmist-dimmed heights.\\n\\nThe rain continued to pour and the torrent to boom, and we continued\\nto enjoy both. At the one spot where this torrent tossed its white mane\\nhighest, and thundered loudest, and lashed the big boulders fiercest,\\nthe canton had done itself the honor to build the flimsiest wooden\\nbridge that exists in the world. While we were walking over it, along\\nwith a party of horsemen, I noticed that even the larger raindrops made\\nit shake. I called Harris\\'s attention to it, and he noticed it, too.\\nIt seemed to me that if I owned an elephant that was a keepsake, and I\\nthought a good deal of him, I would think twice before I would ride him\\nover that bridge.\\n\\nWe climbed up to the village of St. Nicholas, about half past four\\nin the afternoon, waded ankle-deep through the fertilizer-juice, and\\nstopped at a new and nice hotel close by the little church. We stripped\\nand went to bed, and sent our clothes down to be baked. And the horde\\nof soaked tourists did the same. That chaos of clothing got mixed in the\\nkitchen, and there were consequences.\\n\\nI did not get back the same drawers I sent down, when our things came up\\nat six-fifteen; I got a pair on a new plan. They were merely a pair\\nof white ruffle-cuffed absurdities, hitched together at the top with\\na narrow band, and they did not come quite down to my knees. They were\\npretty enough, but they made me feel like two people, and disconnected\\nat that. The man must have been an idiot that got himself up like\\nthat, to rough it in the Swiss mountains. The shirt they brought me\\nwas shorter than the drawers, and hadn\\'t any sleeves to it--at least\\nit hadn\\'t anything more than what Mr. Darwin would call \"rudimentary\"\\nsleeves; these had \"edging\" around them, but the bosom was ridiculously\\nplain. The knit silk undershirt they brought me was on a new plan, and\\nwas really a sensible thing; it opened behind, and had pockets in it to\\nput your shoulder-blades in; but they did not seem to fit mine, and so\\nI found it a sort of uncomfortable garment. They gave my bobtail coat\\nto somebody else, and sent me an ulster suitable for a giraffe. I had\\nto tie my collar on, because there was no button behind on that foolish\\nlittle shirt which I described a while ago.\\n\\nWhen I was dressed for dinner at six-thirty, I was too loose in some\\nplaces and too tight in others, and altogether I felt slovenly and\\nill-conditioned. However, the people at the table d\\'hte were no better\\noff than I was; they had everybody\\'s clothes but their own on. A\\nlong stranger recognized his ulster as soon as he saw the tail of it\\nfollowing me in, but nobody claimed my shirt or my drawers, though I\\ndescribed them as well as I was able. I gave them to the chambermaid\\nthat night when I went to bed, and she probably found the owner, for my\\nown things were on a chair outside my door in the morning.\\n\\nThere was a lovable English clergyman who did not get to the table\\nd\\'hte at all. His breeches had turned up missing, and without any\\nequivalent. He said he was not more particular than other people, but he\\nhad noticed that a clergyman at dinner without any breeches was almost\\nsure to excite remark.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVI\\n\\n[The Fiendish Fun of Alp-climbing]\\n\\nWe did not oversleep at St. Nicholas. The church-bell began to ring at\\nfour-thirty in the morning, and from the length of time it continued\\nto ring I judged that it takes the Swiss sinner a good while to get the\\ninvitation through his head. Most church-bells in the world are of poor\\nquality, and have a harsh and rasping sound which upsets the temper and\\nproduces much sin, but the St. Nicholas bell is a good deal the worst\\none that has been contrived yet, and is peculiarly maddening in its\\noperation. Still, it may have its right and its excuse to exist, for the\\ncommunity is poor and not every citizen can afford a clock, perhaps; but\\nthere cannot be any excuse for our church-bells at home, for there is\\nno family in America without a clock, and consequently there is no fair\\npretext for the usual Sunday medley of dreadful sounds that issues from\\nour steeples. There is much more profanity in America on Sunday than in\\nall in the other six days of the week put together, and it is of a more\\nbitter and malignant character than the week-day profanity, too. It is\\nproduced by the cracked-pot clangor of the cheap church-bells.\\n\\nWe build our churches almost without regard to cost; we rear an edifice\\nwhich is an adornment to the town, and we gild it, and fresco it, and\\nmortgage it, and do everything we can think of to perfect it, and then\\nspoil it all by putting a bell on it which afflicts everybody who hears\\nit, giving some the headache, others St. Vitus\\'s dance, and the rest the\\nblind staggers.\\n\\nAn American village at ten o\\'clock on a summer Sunday is the quietest\\nand peacefulest and holiest thing in nature; but it is a pretty\\ndifferent thing half an hour later. Mr. Poe\\'s poem of the \"Bells\" stands\\nincomplete to this day; but it is well enough that it is so, for the\\npublic reciter or \"reader\" who goes around trying to imitate the sounds\\nof the various sorts of bells with his voice would find himself \"up a\\nstump\" when he got to the church-bell--as Joseph Addison would say. The\\nchurch is always trying to get other people to reform; it might not be\\na bad idea to reform itself a little, by way of example. It is still\\nclinging to one or two things which were useful once, but which are\\nnot useful now, neither are they ornamental. One is the bell-ringing\\nto remind a clock-caked town that it is church-time, and another is the\\nreading from the pulpit of a tedious list of \"notices\" which everybody\\nwho is interested has already read in the newspaper. The clergyman even\\nreads the hymn through--a relic of an ancient time when hymn-books are\\nscarce and costly; but everybody has a hymn-book, now, and so the public\\nreading is no longer necessary. It is not merely unnecessary, it is\\ngenerally painful; for the average clergyman could not fire into his\\ncongregation with a shotgun and hit a worse reader than himself, unless\\nthe weapon scattered shamefully. I am not meaning to be flippant and\\nirreverent, I am only meaning to be truthful. The average clergyman, in\\nall countries and of all denominations, is a very bad reader. One would\\nthink he would at least learn how to read the Lord\\'s Prayer, by and by,\\nbut it is not so. He races through it as if he thought the quicker\\nhe got it in, the sooner it would be answered. A person who does not\\nappreciate the exceeding value of pauses, and does not know how to\\nmeasure their duration judiciously, cannot render the grand simplicity\\nand dignity of a composition like that effectively.\\n\\nWe took a tolerably early breakfast, and tramped off toward Zermatt\\nthrough the reeking lanes of the village, glad to get away from that\\nbell. By and by we had a fine spectacle on our right. It was the\\nwall-like butt end of a huge glacier, which looked down on us from an\\nAlpine height which was well up in the blue sky. It was an astonishing\\namount of ice to be compacted together in one mass. We ciphered upon it\\nand decided that it was not less than several hundred feet from the base\\nof the wall of solid ice to the top of it--Harris believed it was\\nreally twice that. We judged that if St. Paul\\'s, St. Peter\\'s, the Great\\nPyramid, the Strasburg Cathedral and the Capitol in Washington were\\nclustered against that wall, a man sitting on its upper edge could not\\nhang his hat on the top of any one of them without reaching down three\\nor four hundred feet--a thing which, of course, no man could do.\\n\\nTo me, that mighty glacier was very beautiful. I did not imagine that\\nanybody could find fault with it; but I was mistaken. Harris had been\\nsnarling for several days. He was a rabid Protestant, and he was always\\nsaying:\\n\\n\"In the Protestant cantons you never see such poverty and dirt and\\nsqualor as you do in this Catholic one; you never see the lanes and\\nalleys flowing with foulness; you never see such wretched little sties\\nof houses; you never see an inverted tin turnip on top of a church for\\na dome; and as for a church-bell, why, you never hear a church-bell at\\nall.\"\\n\\nAll this morning he had been finding fault, straight along. First it was\\nwith the mud. He said, \"It ain\\'t muddy in a Protestant canton when it\\nrains.\" Then it was with the dogs: \"They don\\'t have those lop-eared dogs\\nin a Protestant canton.\" Then it was with the roads: \"They don\\'t leave\\nthe roads to make themselves in a Protestant canton, the people make\\nthem--and they make a road that _is_ a road, too.\" Next it was the\\ngoats: \"You never see a goat shedding tears in a Protestant canton--a\\ngoat, there, is one of the cheerfulest objects in nature.\" Next it\\nwas the chamois: \"You never see a Protestant chamois act like one of\\nthese--they take a bite or two and go; but these fellows camp with you\\nand stay.\" Then it was the guide-boards: \"In a Protestant canton you\\ncouldn\\'t get lost if you wanted to, but you never see a guide-board in a\\nCatholic canton.\" Next, \"You never see any flower-boxes in the windows,\\nhere--never anything but now and then a cat--a torpid one; but you take\\na Protestant canton: windows perfectly lovely with flowers--and as for\\ncats, there\\'s just acres of them. These folks in this canton leave a\\nroad to make itself, and then fine you three francs if you \\'trot\\' over\\nit--as if a horse could trot over such a sarcasm of a road.\" Next about\\nthe goiter: \"_They_ talk about goiter!--I haven\\'t seen a goiter in this\\nwhole canton that I couldn\\'t put in a hat.\"\\n\\nHe had growled at everything, but I judged it would puzzle him to find\\nanything the matter with this majestic glacier. I intimated as much; but\\nhe was ready, and said with surly discontent: \"You ought to see them in\\nthe Protestant cantons.\"\\n\\nThis irritated me. But I concealed the feeling, and asked:\\n\\n\"What is the matter with this one?\"\\n\\n\"Matter? Why, it ain\\'t in any kind of condition. They never take any\\ncare of a glacier here. The moraine has been spilling gravel around it,\\nand got it all dirty.\"\\n\\n\"Why, man, _they_ can\\'t help that.\"\\n\\n\"_They_? You\\'re right. That is, they _won\\'t_. They could if they wanted\\nto. You never see a speck of dirt on a Protestant glacier. Look at the\\nRhone glacier. It is fifteen miles long, and seven hundred feet thick.\\nIf this was a Protestant glacier you wouldn\\'t see it looking like this,\\nI can tell you.\"\\n\\n\"That is nonsense. What would they do with it?\"\\n\\n\"They would whitewash it. They always do.\"\\n\\nI did not believe a word of this, but rather than have trouble I let it\\ngo; for it is a waste of breath to argue with a bigot. I even doubted if\\nthe Rhone glacier _was_ in a Protestant canton; but I did not know, so I\\ncould not make anything by contradicting a man who would probably put me\\ndown at once with manufactured evidence.\\n\\nAbout nine miles from St. Nicholas we crossed a bridge over the raging\\ntorrent of the Visp, and came to a log strip of flimsy fencing which\\nwas pretending to secure people from tumbling over a perpendicular wall\\nforty feet high and into the river. Three children were approaching; one\\nof them, a little girl, about eight years old, was running; when pretty\\nclose to us she stumbled and fell, and her feet shot under the rail of\\nthe fence and for a moment projected over the stream. It gave us a\\nsharp shock, for we thought she was gone, sure, for the ground slanted\\nsteeply, and to save herself seemed a sheer impossibility; but she\\nmanaged to scramble up, and ran by us laughing.\\n\\nWe went forward and examined the place and saw the long tracks which her\\nfeet had made in the dirt when they darted over the verge. If she had\\nfinished her trip she would have struck some big rocks in the edge of\\nthe water, and then the torrent would have snatched her downstream among\\nthe half-covered boulders and she would have been pounded to pulp in two\\nminutes. We had come exceedingly near witnessing her death.\\n\\nAnd now Harris\\'s contrary nature and inborn selfishness were strikingly\\nmanifested. He has no spirit of self-denial. He began straight off, and\\ncontinued for an hour, to express his gratitude that the child was not\\ndestroyed. I never saw such a man. That was the kind of person he was;\\njust so _he_ was gratified, he never cared anything about anybody else.\\nI had noticed that trait in him, over and over again. Often, of course,\\nit was mere heedlessness, mere want of reflection. Doubtless this may\\nhave been the case in most instances, but it was not the less hard to\\nbar on that account--and after all, its bottom, its groundwork, was\\nselfishness. There is no avoiding that conclusion. In the instance under\\nconsideration, I did think the indecency of running on in that way might\\noccur to him; but no, the child was saved and he was glad, that was\\nsufficient--he cared not a straw for _my_ feelings, or my loss of such\\na literary plum, snatched from my very mouth at the instant it was\\nready to drop into it. His selfishness was sufficient to place his own\\ngratification in being spared suffering clear before all concern for\\nme, his friend. Apparently, he did not once reflect upon the valuable\\ndetails which would have fallen like a windfall to me: fishing the child\\nout--witnessing the surprise of the family and the stir the thing would\\nhave made among the peasants--then a Swiss funeral--then the roadside\\nmonument, to be paid for by us and have our names mentioned in it. And\\nwe should have gone into Baedeker and been immortal. I was silent. I was\\ntoo much hurt to complain. If he could act so, and be so heedless and so\\nfrivolous at such a time, and actually seem to glory in it, after all\\nI had done for him, I would have cut my hand off before I would let him\\nsee that I was wounded.\\n\\nWe were approaching Zermatt; consequently, we were approaching the\\nrenowned Matterhorn. A month before, this mountain had been only a name\\nto us, but latterly we had been moving through a steadily thickening\\ndouble row of pictures of it, done in oil, water, chromo, wood, steel,\\ncopper, crayon, and photography, and so it had at length become a shape\\nto us--and a very distinct, decided, and familiar one, too. We were\\nexpecting to recognize that mountain whenever or wherever we should run\\nacross it. We were not deceived. The monarch was far away when we first\\nsaw him, but there was no such thing as mistaking him. He has the rare\\npeculiarity of standing by himself; he is peculiarly steep, too, and is\\nalso most oddly shaped. He towers into the sky like a colossal wedge,\\nwith the upper third of its blade bent a little to the left. The broad\\nbase of this monster wedge is planted upon a grand glacier-paved Alpine\\nplatform whose elevation is ten thousand feet above sea-level; as the\\nwedge itself is some five thousand feet high, it follows that its apex\\nis about fifteen thousand feet above sea-level. So the whole bulk of\\nthis stately piece of rock, this sky-cleaving monolith, is above the\\nline of eternal snow. Yet while all its giant neighbors have the look of\\nbeing built of solid snow, from their waists up, the Matterhorn stands\\nblack and naked and forbidding, the year round, or merely powdered or\\nstreaked with white in places, for its sides are so steep that the\\nsnow cannot stay there. Its strange form, its august isolation, and its\\nmajestic unkinship with its own kind, make it--so to speak--the Napoleon\\nof the mountain world. \"Grand, gloomy, and peculiar,\" is a phrase which\\nfits it as aptly as it fitted the great captain.\\n\\nThink of a monument a mile high, standing on a pedestal two miles high!\\nThis is what the Matterhorn is--a monument. Its office, henceforth, for\\nall time, will be to keep watch and ward over the secret resting-place\\nof the young Lord Douglas, who, in 1865, was precipitated from the\\nsummit over a precipice four thousand feet high, and never seen again.\\nNo man ever had such a monument as this before; the most imposing of\\nthe world\\'s other monuments are but atoms compared to it; and they will\\nperish, and their places will pass from memory, but this will remain.\\n\\n[The accident which cost Lord Douglas his life (see Chapter xii) also\\ncost the lives of three other men. These three fell four-fifths of a\\nmile, and their bodies were afterward found, lying side by side, upon a\\nglacier, whence they were borne to Zermatt and buried in the churchyard.\\n\\nThe remains of Lord Douglas have never been found. The secret of his\\nsepulture, like that of Moses, must remain a mystery always.]\\n\\nA walk from St. Nicholas to Zermatt is a wonderful experience. Nature\\nis built on a stupendous plan in that region. One marches continually\\nbetween walls that are piled into the skies, with their upper heights\\nbroken into a confusion of sublime shapes that gleam white and cold\\nagainst the background of blue; and here and there one sees a big\\nglacier displaying its grandeurs on the top of a precipice, or a\\ngraceful cascade leaping and flashing down the green declivities. There\\nis nothing tame, or cheap, or trivial--it is all magnificent. That\\nshort valley is a picture-gallery of a notable kind, for it contains\\nno mediocrities; from end to end the Creator has hung it with His\\nmasterpieces.\\n\\nWe made Zermatt at three in the afternoon, nine hours out from\\nSt. Nicholas. Distance, by guide-book, twelve miles; by pedometer\\nseventy-two. We were in the heart and home of the mountain-climbers,\\nnow, as all visible things testified. The snow-peaks did not hold\\nthemselves aloof, in aristocratic reserve; they nestled close around,\\nin a friendly, sociable way; guides, with the ropes and axes and other\\nimplements of their fearful calling slung about their persons, roosted\\nin a long line upon a stone wall in front of the hotel, and waited for\\ncustomers; sun-burnt climbers, in mountaineering costume, and followed\\nby their guides and porters, arrived from time to time, from breakneck\\nexpeditions among the peaks and glaciers of the High Alps; male and\\nfemale tourists, on mules, filed by, in a continuous procession,\\nhotelward-bound from wild adventures which would grow in grandeur every\\ntime they were described at the English or American fireside, and at\\nlast outgrow the possible itself.\\n\\nWe were not dreaming; this was not a make-believe home of the\\nAlp-climber, created by our heated imaginations; no, for here was Mr.\\nGirdlestone himself, the famous Englishman who hunts his way to the most\\nformidable Alpine summits without a guide. I was not equal to imagining\\na Girdlestone; it was all I could do to even realize him, while looking\\nstraight at him at short range. I would rather face whole Hyde Parks of\\nartillery than the ghastly forms of death which he has faced among the\\npeaks and precipices of the mountains. There is probably no pleasure\\nequal to the pleasure of climbing a dangerous Alp; but it is a pleasure\\nwhich is confined strictly to people who can find pleasure in it. I have\\nnot jumped to this conclusion; I have traveled to it per gravel-train,\\nso to speak. I have thought the thing all out, and am quite sure I am\\nright. A born climber\\'s appetite for climbing is hard to satisfy; when\\nit comes upon him he is like a starving man with a feast before him; he\\nmay have other business on hand, but it must wait. Mr. Girdlestone had\\nhad his usual summer holiday in the Alps, and had spent it in his usual\\nway, hunting for unique chances to break his neck; his vacation was\\nover, and his luggage packed for England, but all of a sudden a hunger\\nhad come upon him to climb the tremendous Weisshorn once more, for he\\nhad heard of a new and utterly impossible route up it. His baggage\\nwas unpacked at once, and now he and a friend, laden with knapsacks,\\nice-axes, coils of rope, and canteens of milk, were just setting out.\\nThey would spend the night high up among the snows, somewhere, and\\nget up at two in the morning and finish the enterprise. I had a\\nstrong desire to go with them, but forced it down--a feat which Mr.\\nGirdlestone, with all his fortitude, could not do.\\n\\nEven ladies catch the climbing mania, and are unable to throw it off.\\nA famous climber, of that sex, had attempted the Weisshorn a few days\\nbefore our arrival, and she and her guides had lost their way in a\\nsnow-storm high up among the peaks and glaciers and been forced to\\nwander around a good while before they could find a way down. When this\\nlady reached the bottom, she had been on her feet twenty-three hours!\\n\\nOur guides, hired on the Gemmi, were already at Zermatt when we\\nreached there. So there was nothing to interfere with our getting up an\\nadventure whenever we should choose the time and the object. I resolved\\nto devote my first evening in Zermatt to studying up the subject of\\nAlpine climbing, by way of preparation.\\n\\nI read several books, and here are some of the things I found out. One\\'s\\nshoes must be strong and heavy, and have pointed hobnails in them. The\\nalpenstock must be of the best wood, for if it should break, loss of\\nlife might be the result. One should carry an ax, to cut steps in the\\nice with, on the great heights. There must be a ladder, for there are\\nsteep bits of rock which can be surmounted with this instrument--or this\\nutensil--but could not be surmounted without it; such an obstruction\\nhas compelled the tourist to waste hours hunting another route, when a\\nladder would have saved him all trouble. One must have from one hundred\\nand fifty to five hundred feet of strong rope, to be used in lowering\\nthe party down steep declivities which are too steep and smooth to\\nbe traversed in any other way. One must have a steel hook, on another\\nrope--a very useful thing; for when one is ascending and comes to a low\\nbluff which is yet too high for the ladder, he swings this rope aloft\\nlike a lasso, the hook catches at the top of the bluff, and then the\\ntourist climbs the rope, hand over hand--being always particular to try\\nand forget that if the hook gives way he will never stop falling till\\nhe arrives in some part of Switzerland where they are not expecting him.\\nAnother important thing--there must be a rope to tie the whole party\\ntogether with, so that if one falls from a mountain or down a bottomless\\nchasm in a glacier, the others may brace back on the rope and save him.\\nOne must have a silk veil, to protect his face from snow, sleet, hail\\nand gale, and colored goggles to protect his eyes from that dangerous\\nenemy, snow-blindness. Finally, there must be some porters, to carry\\nprovisions, wine and scientific instruments, and also blanket bags for\\nthe party to sleep in.\\n\\nI closed my readings with a fearful adventure which Mr. Whymper once had\\non the Matterhorn when he was prowling around alone, five thousand\\nfeet above the town of Breil. He was edging his way gingerly around\\nthe corner of a precipice where the upper edge of a sharp declivity of\\nice-glazed snow joined it. This declivity swept down a couple of hundred\\nfeet, into a gully which curved around and ended at a precipice eight\\nhundred feet high, overlooking a glacier. His foot slipped, and he fell.\\n\\nHe says:\\n\\n\"My knapsack brought my head down first, and I pitched into some rocks\\nabout a dozen feet below; they caught something, and tumbled me off\\nthe edge, head over heels, into the gully; the baton was dashed from my\\nhands, and I whirled downward in a series of bounds, each longer than\\nthe last; now over ice, now into rocks, striking my head four or five\\ntimes, each time with increased force. The last bound sent me spinning\\nthrough the air in a leap of fifty or sixty feet, from one side of the\\ngully to the other, and I struck the rocks, luckily, with the whole of\\nmy left side. They caught my clothes for a moment, and I fell back on to\\nthe snow with motion arrested. My head fortunately came the right side\\nup, and a few frantic catches brought me to a halt, in the neck of the\\ngully and on the verge of the precipice. Baton, hat, and veil skimmed\\nby and disappeared, and the crash of the rocks--which I had started--as\\nthey fell on to the glacier, told how narrow had been the escape from\\nutter destruction. As it was, I fell nearly two hundred feet in seven or\\neight bounds. Ten feet more would have taken me in one gigantic leap of\\neight hundred feet on to the glacier below.\\n\\n\"The situation was sufficiently serious. The rocks could not be let go\\nfor a moment, and the blood was spurting out of more than twenty cuts.\\nThe most serious ones were in the head, and I vainly tried to close\\nthem with one hand, while holding on with the other. It was useless;\\nthe blood gushed out in blinding jets at each pulsation. At last, in a\\nmoment of inspiration, I kicked out a big lump of snow and struck it\\nas plaster on my head. The idea was a happy one, and the flow of blood\\ndiminished. Then, scrambling up, I got, not a moment too soon, to\\na place of safety, and fainted away. The sun was setting when\\nconsciousness returned, and it was pitch-dark before the Great Staircase\\nwas descended; but by a combination of luck and care, the whole four\\nthousand seven hundred feet of descent to Breil was accomplished without\\na slip, or once missing the way.\"\\n\\nHis wounds kept him abed some days. Then he got up and climbed that\\nmountain again. That is the way with a true Alp-climber; the more fun he\\nhas, the more he wants.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVII\\n\\n[Our Imposing Column Starts Upward]\\n\\nAfter I had finished my readings, I was no longer myself; I was tranced,\\nuplifted, intoxicated, by the almost incredible perils and adventures\\nI had been following my authors through, and the triumphs I had been\\nsharing with them. I sat silent some time, then turned to Harris and\\nsaid:\\n\\n\"My mind is made up.\"\\n\\nSomething in my tone struck him: and when he glanced at my eye and\\nread what was written there, his face paled perceptibly. He hesitated a\\nmoment, then said:\\n\\n\"Speak.\"\\n\\nI answered, with perfect calmness:\\n\\n\"I will ascend the Riffelberg.\"\\n\\nIf I had shot my poor friend he could not have fallen from his chair\\nmore suddenly. If I had been his father he could not have pleaded harder\\nto get me to give up my purpose. But I turned a deaf ear to all he said.\\nWhen he perceived at last that nothing could alter my determination, he\\nceased to urge, and for a while the deep silence was broken only by his\\nsobs. I sat in marble resolution, with my eyes fixed upon vacancy, for\\nin spirit I was already wrestling with the perils of the mountains, and\\nmy friend sat gazing at me in adoring admiration through his tears.\\nAt last he threw himself upon me in a loving embrace and exclaimed in\\nbroken tones:\\n\\n\"Your Harris will never desert you. We will die together.\"\\n\\nI cheered the noble fellow with praises, and soon his fears were\\nforgotten and he was eager for the adventure. He wanted to summon the\\nguides at once and leave at two in the morning, as he supposed the\\ncustom was; but I explained that nobody was looking at that hour; and\\nthat the start in the dark was not usually made from the village but\\nfrom the first night\\'s resting-place on the mountain side. I said we\\nwould leave the village at 3 or 4 P.M. on the morrow; meantime he could\\nnotify the guides, and also let the public know of the attempt which we\\nproposed to make.\\n\\nI went to bed, but not to sleep. No man can sleep when he is about to\\nundertake one of these Alpine exploits. I tossed feverishly all night\\nlong, and was glad enough when I heard the clock strike half past eleven\\nand knew it was time to get up for dinner. I rose, jaded and rusty, and\\nwent to the noon meal, where I found myself the center of interest and\\ncuriosity; for the news was already abroad. It is not easy to eat calmly\\nwhen you are a lion; but it is very pleasant, nevertheless.\\n\\nAs usual, at Zermatt, when a great ascent is about to be undertaken,\\neverybody, native and foreign, laid aside his own projects and took up\\na good position to observe the start. The expedition consisted of 198\\npersons, including the mules; or 205, including the cows. As follows:\\n\\n CHIEFS OF SERVICE  SUBORDINATES\\n\\n Myself 1 Veterinary Surgeon  Mr. Harris 1 Butler 17 Guides 12 Waiters\\n4 Surgeons 1 Footman 1 Geologist 1 Barber 1 Botanist 1 Head Cook\\n3 Chaplains 9 Assistants 2 Draftsman 4 Pastry Cooks 15 Barkeepers 1\\nConfectionery Artist 1 Latinist\\n\\n TRANSPORTATION, ETC.\\n\\n27 Porters 3 Coarse Washers and Ironers 44 Mules 1 Fine ditto 44\\nMuleteers 7 Cows   2 Milkers Total, 154 men, 51 animals.

At that hour it began to move. In point of numbers and\\nspectacular effect, it was the most imposing expedition that had ever\\nmarched from Zermatt.\\n\\nI commanded the chief guide to arrange the men and animals in single\\nfile, twelve feet apart, and lash them all together on a strong rope. He\\nobjected that the first two miles was a dead level, with plenty of room,\\nand that the rope was never used except in very dangerous places. But\\nI would not listen to that. My reading had taught me that many serious\\naccidents had happened in the Alps simply from not having the people\\ntied up soon enough; I was not going to add one to the list. The guide\\nthen obeyed my order.\\n\\nWhen the procession stood at ease, roped together, and ready to move, I\\nnever saw a finer sight. It was 3,122 feet long--over half a mile; every\\nman and me was on foot, and had on his green veil and his blue goggles,\\nand his white rag around his hat, and his coil of rope over one shoulder\\nand under the other, and his ice-ax in his belt, and carried his\\nalpenstock in his left hand, his umbrella (closed) in his right, and his\\ncrutches slung at his back. The burdens of the pack-mules and the horns\\nof the cows were decked with the Edelweiss and the Alpine rose.\\n\\nI and my agent were the only persons mounted. We were in the post of\\ndanger in the extreme rear, and tied securely to five guides apiece. Our\\narmor-bearers carried our ice-axes, alpenstocks, and other implements\\nfor us. We were mounted upon very small donkeys, as a measure of safety;\\nin time of peril we could straighten our legs and stand up, and let\\nthe donkey walk from under. Still, I cannot recommend this sort of\\nanimal--at least for excursions of mere pleasure--because his\\nears interrupt the view. I and my agent possessed the regulation\\nmountaineering costumes, but concluded to leave them behind. Out of\\nrespect for the great numbers of tourists of both sexes who would be\\nassembled in front of the hotels to see us pass, and also out of respect\\nfor the many tourists whom we expected to encounter on our expedition,\\nwe decided to make the ascent in evening dress.\\n\\nWe watered the caravan at the cold stream which rushes down a trough\\nnear the end of the village, and soon afterward left the haunts of\\ncivilization behind us. About half past five o\\'clock we arrived at a\\nbridge which spans the Visp, and after throwing over a detachment to see\\nif it was safe, the caravan crossed without accident. The way now led,\\nby a gentle ascent, carpeted with fresh green grass, to the church at\\nWinkelmatten. Without stopping to examine this edifice, I executed\\na flank movement to the right and crossed the bridge over the\\nFindelenbach, after first testing its strength. Here I deployed to the\\nright again, and presently entered an inviting stretch of meadowland\\nwhich was unoccupied save by a couple of deserted huts toward the\\nfurthest extremity. These meadows offered an excellent camping-place.\\nWe pitched our tents, supped, established a proper grade, recorded the\\nevents of the day, and then went to bed.\\n\\nWe rose at two in the morning and dressed by candle-light. It was a\\ndismal and chilly business. A few stars were shining, but the general\\nheavens were overcast, and the great shaft of the Matterhorn was draped\\nin a cable pall of clouds. The chief guide advised a delay; he said he\\nfeared it was going to rain. We waited until nine o\\'clock, and then got\\naway in tolerably clear weather.\\n\\nOur course led up some terrific steeps, densely wooded with larches and\\ncedars, and traversed by paths which the rains had guttered and which\\nwere obstructed by loose stones. To add to the danger and inconvenience,\\nwe were constantly meeting returning tourists on foot and horseback, and\\nas constantly being crowded and battered by ascending tourists who were\\nin a hurry and wanted to get by.\\n\\nOur troubles thickened. About the middle of the afternoon the seventeen\\nguides called a halt and held a consultation. After consulting an hour\\nthey said their first suspicion remained intact--that is to say, they\\nbelieved they were lost. I asked if they did not _know_ it? No, they\\nsaid, they _couldn\\'t_ absolutely know whether they were lost or not,\\nbecause none of them had ever been in that part of the country before.\\nThey had a strong instinct that they were lost, but they had no\\nproofs--except that they did not know where they were. They had met no\\ntourists for some time, and they considered that a suspicious sign.\\n\\nPlainly we were in an ugly fix. The guides were naturally unwilling to\\ngo alone and seek a way out of the difficulty; so we all went together.\\nFor better security we moved slow and cautiously, for the forest was\\nvery dense. We did not move up the mountain, but around it, hoping to\\nstrike across the old trail. Toward nightfall, when we were about tired\\nout, we came up against a rock as big as a cottage. This barrier took\\nall the remaining spirit out of the men, and a panic of fear and despair\\nensued. They moaned and wept, and said they should never see their homes\\nand their dear ones again. Then they began to upbraid me for bringing\\nthem upon this fatal expedition. Some even muttered threats against me.\\n\\nClearly it was no time to show weakness. So I made a speech in which I\\nsaid that other Alp-climbers had been in as perilous a position as this,\\nand yet by courage and perseverance had escaped. I promised to stand\\nby them, I promised to rescue them. I closed by saying we had plenty\\nof provisions to maintain us for quite a siege--and did they suppose\\nZermatt would allow half a mile of men and mules to mysteriously\\ndisappear during any considerable time, right above their noses, and\\nmake no inquiries? No, Zermatt would send out searching-expeditions and\\nwe should be saved.\\n\\nThis speech had a great effect. The men pitched the tents with some\\nlittle show of cheerfulness, and we were snugly under cover when the\\nnight shut down. I now reaped the reward of my wisdom in providing one\\narticle which is not mentioned in any book of Alpine adventure but this.\\nI refer to the paregoric. But for that beneficent drug, would have not\\none of those men slept a moment during that fearful night. But for that\\ngentle persuader they must have tossed, unsoothed, the night through;\\nfor the whiskey was for me. Yes, they would have risen in the morning\\nunfitted for their heavy task. As it was, everybody slept but my agent\\nand me--only we and the barkeepers. I would not permit myself to sleep\\nat such a time. I considered myself responsible for all those lives. I\\nmeant to be on hand and ready, in case of avalanches up there, but I did\\nnot know it then.\\n\\nWe watched the weather all through that awful night, and kept an eye on\\nthe barometer, to be prepared for the least change. There was not the\\nslightest change recorded by the instrument, during the whole time.\\nWords cannot describe the comfort that that friendly, hopeful, steadfast\\nthing was to me in that season of trouble. It was a defective barometer,\\nand had no hand but the stationary brass pointer, but I did not know\\nthat until afterward. If I should be in such a situation again, I should\\nnot wish for any barometer but that one.\\n\\nAll hands rose at two in the morning and took breakfast, and as soon as\\nit was light we roped ourselves together and went at that rock. For some\\ntime we tried the hook-rope and other means of scaling it, but without\\nsuccess--that is, without perfect success. The hook caught once, and\\nHarris started up it hand over hand, but the hold broke and if there\\nhad not happened to be a chaplain sitting underneath at the time, Harris\\nwould certainly have been crippled. As it was, it was the chaplain. He\\ntook to his crutches, and I ordered the hook-rope to be laid aside. It\\nwas too dangerous an implement where so many people are standing around.\\n\\nWe were puzzled for a while; then somebody thought of the ladders.\\nOne of these was leaned against the rock, and the men went up it tied\\ntogether in couples. Another ladder was sent up for use in descending.\\nAt the end of half an hour everybody was over, and that rock was\\nconquered. We gave our first grand shout of triumph. But the joy was\\nshort-lived, for somebody asked how we were going to get the animals\\nover.\\n\\nThis was a serious difficulty; in fact, it was an impossibility.\\nThe courage of the men began to waver immediately; once more we were\\nthreatened with a panic. But when the danger was most imminent, we were\\nsaved in a mysterious way. A mule which had attracted attention from the\\nbeginning by its disposition to experiment, tried to eat a five-pound\\ncan of nitroglycerin. This happened right alongside the rock. The\\nexplosion threw us all to the ground, and covered us with dirt and\\ndebris; it frightened us extremely, too, for the crash it made was\\ndeafening, and the violence of the shock made the ground tremble.\\nHowever, we were grateful, for the rock was gone. Its place was occupied\\nby a new cellar, about thirty feet across, by fifteen feet deep. The\\nexplosion was heard as far as Zermatt; and an hour and a half afterward,\\nmany citizens of that town were knocked down and quite seriously injured\\nby descending portions of mule meat, frozen solid. This shows, better\\nthan any estimate in figures, how high the experimenter went.\\n\\nWe had nothing to do, now, but bridge the cellar and proceed on our way.\\nWith a cheer the men went at their work. I attended to the engineering,\\nmyself. I appointed a strong detail to cut down trees with ice-axes and\\ntrim them for piers to support the bridge. This was a slow business, for\\nice-axes are not good to cut wood with. I caused my piers to be firmly\\nset up in ranks in the cellar, and upon them I laid six of my forty-foot\\nladders, side by side, and laid six more on top of them. Upon this\\nbridge I caused a bed of boughs to be spread, and on top of the boughs\\na bed of earth six inches deep. I stretched ropes upon either side to\\nserve as railings, and then my bridge was complete. A train of elephants\\ncould have crossed it in safety and comfort. By nightfall the caravan\\nwas on the other side and the ladders were taken up.\\n\\nNext morning we went on in good spirits for a while, though our way\\nwas slow and difficult, by reason of the steep and rocky nature of the\\nground and the thickness of the forest; but at last a dull despondency\\ncrept into the men\\'s faces and it was apparent that not only they, but\\neven the guides, were now convinced that we were lost. The fact that we\\nstill met no tourists was a circumstance that was but too significant.\\nAnother thing seemed to suggest that we were not only lost, but very\\nbadly lost; for there must surely be searching-parties on the road\\nbefore this time, yet we had seen no sign of them.\\n\\nDemoralization was spreading; something must be done, and done quickly,\\ntoo. Fortunately, I am not unfertile in expedients. I contrived one\\nnow which commended itself to all, for it promised well. I took\\nthree-quarters of a mile of rope and fastened one end of it around the\\nwaist of a guide, and told him to go find the road, while the caravan\\nwaited. I instructed him to guide himself back by the rope, in case of\\nfailure; in case of success, he was to give the rope a series of violent\\njerks, whereupon the Expedition would go to him at once. He departed,\\nand in two minutes had disappeared among the trees. I payed out the rope\\nmyself, while everybody watched the crawling thing with eager eyes.\\nThe rope crept away quite slowly, at times, at other times with some\\nbriskness. Twice or thrice we seemed to get the signal, and a shout was\\njust ready to break from the men\\'s lips when they perceived it was a\\nfalse alarm. But at last, when over half a mile of rope had slidden\\naway, it stopped gliding and stood absolutely still--one minute--two\\nminutes--three--while we held our breath and watched.\\n\\nWas the guide resting? Was he scanning the country from some high point?\\nWas he inquiring of a chance mountaineer? Stop,--had he fainted from\\nexcess of fatigue and anxiety?\\n\\nThis thought gave us a shock. I was in the very first act of detailing\\nan Expedition to succor him, when the cord was assailed with a series of\\nsuch frantic jerks that I could hardly keep hold of it. The huzza that\\nwent up, then, was good to hear. \"Saved! saved!\" was the word that rang\\nout, all down the long rank of the caravan.\\n\\nWe rose up and started at once. We found the route to be good enough\\nfor a while, but it began to grow difficult, by and by, and this feature\\nsteadily increased. When we judged we had gone half a mile, we momently\\nexpected to see the guide; but no, he was not visible anywhere; neither\\nwas he waiting, for the rope was still moving, consequently he was\\ndoing the same. This argued that he had not found the road, yet, but\\nwas marching to it with some peasant. There was nothing for us to do\\nbut plod along--and this we did. At the end of three hours we were\\nstill plodding. This was not only mysterious, but exasperating. And very\\nfatiguing, too; for we had tried hard, along at first, to catch up with\\nthe guide, but had only fagged ourselves, in vain; for although he was\\ntraveling slowly he was yet able to go faster than the hampered caravan\\nover such ground.\\n\\nAt three in the afternoon we were nearly dead with exhaustion--and still\\nthe rope was slowly gliding out. The murmurs against the guide had been\\ngrowing steadily, and at last they were become loud and savage. A mutiny\\nensued. The men refused to proceed. They declared that we had been\\ntraveling over and over the same ground all day, in a kind of circle.\\nThey demanded that our end of the rope be made fast to a tree, so as to\\nhalt the guide until we could overtake him and kill him. This was not an\\nunreasonable requirement, so I gave the order.\\n\\nAs soon as the rope was tied, the Expedition moved forward with that\\nalacrity which the thirst for vengeance usually inspires. But after a\\ntiresome march of almost half a mile, we came to a hill covered thick\\nwith a crumbly rubbish of stones, and so steep that no man of us all\\nwas now in a condition to climb it. Every attempt failed, and ended in\\ncrippling somebody. Within twenty minutes I had five men on crutches.\\n\\nWhenever a climber tried to assist himself by the rope, it yielded and\\nlet him tumble backward. The frequency of this result suggested an idea\\nto me. I ordered the caravan to \\'bout face and form in marching order; I\\nthen made the tow-rope fast to the rear mule, and gave the command:\\n\\n\"Mark time--by the right flank--forward--march!\"\\n\\nThe procession began to move, to the impressive strains of a\\nbattle-chant, and I said to myself, \"Now, if the rope don\\'t break I\\njudge _this_ will fetch that guide into the camp.\" I watched the rope\\ngliding down the hill, and presently when I was all fixed for triumph\\nI was confronted by a bitter disappointment; there was no guide tied to\\nthe rope, it was only a very indignant old black ram. The fury of the\\nbaffled Expedition exceeded all bounds. They even wanted to wreak their\\nunreasoning vengeance on this innocent dumb brute. But I stood between\\nthem and their prey, menaced by a bristling wall of ice-axes and\\nalpenstocks, and proclaimed that there was but one road to this murder,\\nand it was directly over my corpse. Even as I spoke I saw that my doom\\nwas sealed, except a miracle supervened to divert these madmen from\\ntheir fell purpose. I see the sickening wall of weapons now; I see that\\nadvancing host as I saw it then, I see the hate in those cruel eyes; I\\nremember how I drooped my head upon my breast, I feel again the\\nsudden earthquake shock in my rear, administered by the very ram I was\\nsacrificing myself to save; I hear once more the typhoon of laughter\\nthat burst from the assaulting column as I clove it from van to rear\\nlike a Sepoy shot from a Rodman gun.\\n\\nI was saved. Yes, I was saved, and by the merciful instinct of\\ningratitude which nature had planted in the breast of that treacherous\\nbeast. The grace which eloquence had failed to work in those men\\'s\\nhearts, had been wrought by a laugh. The ram was set free and my life\\nwas spared.\\n\\nWe lived to find out that that guide had deserted us as soon as he had\\nplaced a half-mile between himself and us. To avert suspicion, he had\\njudged it best that the line should continue to move; so he caught that\\nram, and at the time that he was sitting on it making the rope fast to\\nit, we were imagining that he was lying in a swoon, overcome by fatigue\\nand distress. When he allowed the ram to get up it fell to plunging\\naround, trying to rid itself of the rope, and this was the signal which\\nwe had risen up with glad shouts to obey. We had followed this ram round\\nand round in a circle all day--a thing which was proven by the discovery\\nthat we had watered the Expedition seven times at one and same spring in\\nseven hours. As expert a woodman as I am, I had somehow failed to notice\\nthis until my attention was called to it by a hog. This hog was always\\nwallowing there, and as he was the only hog we saw, his frequent\\nrepetition, together with his unvarying similarity to himself, finally\\ncaused me to reflect that he must be the same hog, and this led me to\\nthe deduction that this must be the same spring, also--which indeed it\\nwas.\\n\\nI made a note of this curious thing, as showing in a striking manner the\\nrelative difference between glacial action and the action of the hog.\\nIt is now a well-established fact that glaciers move; I consider that\\nmy observations go to show, with equal conclusiveness, that a hog in a\\nspring does not move. I shall be glad to receive the opinions of other\\nobservers upon this point.\\n\\nTo return, for an explanatory moment, to that guide, and then I shall be\\ndone with him. After leaving the ram tied to the rope, he had wandered\\nat large a while, and then happened to run across a cow. Judging that a\\ncow would naturally know more than a guide, he took her by the tail,\\nand the result justified his judgment. She nibbled her leisurely way\\ndownhill till it was near milking-time, then she struck for home and\\ntowed him into Zermatt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\\n\\n[I Conquer the Gorner Grat]\\n\\nWe went into camp on that wild spot to which that ram had brought us.\\nThe men were greatly fatigued. Their conviction that we were lost was\\nforgotten in the cheer of a good supper, and before the reaction had a\\nchance to set in, I loaded them up with paregoric and put them to bed.\\n\\nNext morning I was considering in my mind our desperate situation and\\ntrying to think of a remedy, when Harris came to me with a Baedeker\\nmap which showed conclusively that the mountain we were on was still in\\nSwitzerland--yes, every part of it was in Switzerland. So we were not\\nlost, after all. This was an immense relief; it lifted the weight of two\\nsuch mountains from my breast. I immediately had the news disseminated\\nand the map was exhibited. The effect was wonderful. As soon as the men\\nsaw with their own eyes that they knew where they were, and that it\\nwas only the summit that was lost and not themselves, they cheered up\\ninstantly and said with one accord, let the summit take care of itself.\\n\\nOur distresses being at an end, I now determined to rest the men in camp\\nand give the scientific department of the Expedition a chance. First,\\nI made a barometric observation, to get our altitude, but I could not\\nperceive that there was any result. I knew, by my scientific reading,\\nthat either thermometers or barometers ought to be boiled, to make them\\naccurate; I did not know which it was, so I boiled them both. There was\\nstill no result; so I examined these instruments and discovered that\\nthey possessed radical blemishes: the barometer had no hand but the\\nbrass pointer and the ball of the thermometer was stuffed with tin-foil.\\nI might have boiled those things to rags, and never found out anything.\\n\\nI hunted up another barometer; it was new and perfect. I boiled it half\\nan hour in a pot of bean soup which the cooks were making. The result\\nwas unexpected: the instrument was not affecting at all, but there was\\nsuch a strong barometer taste to the soup that the head cook, who was\\na most conscientious person, changed its name in the bill of fare.\\nThe dish was so greatly liked by all, that I ordered the cook to have\\nbarometer soup every day.\\n\\nIt was believed that the barometer might eventually be injured, but I\\ndid not care for that. I had demonstrated to my satisfaction that it\\ncould not tell how high a mountain was, therefore I had no real use for\\nit. Changes in the weather I could take care of without it; I did not\\nwish to know when the weather was going to be good, what I wanted to\\nknow was when it was going to be bad, and this I could find out from\\nHarris\\'s corns. Harris had had his corns tested and regulated at the\\ngovernment observatory in Heidelberg, and one could depend upon them\\nwith confidence. So I transferred the new barometer to the cooking\\ndepartment, to be used for the official mess. It was found that even a\\npretty fair article of soup could be made from the defective barometer;\\nso I allowed that one to be transferred to the subordinate mess.\\n\\nI next boiled the thermometer, and got a most excellent result; the\\nmercury went up to about 200 degrees Fahrenheit. In the opinion of the\\nother scientists of the Expedition, this seemed to indicate that we had\\nattained the extraordinary altitude of two hundred thousand feet above\\nsea-level. Science places the line of eternal snow at about ten thousand\\nfeet above sea-level. There was no snow where we were, consequently\\nit was proven that the eternal snow-line ceases somewhere above the\\nten-thousand-foot level and does not begin any more. This was an\\ninteresting fact, and one which had not been observed by any observer\\nbefore. It was as valuable as interesting, too, since it would open up\\nthe deserted summits of the highest Alps to population and agriculture.\\nIt was a proud thing to be where we were, yet it caused us a pang\\nto reflect that but for that ram we might just as well have been two\\nhundred thousand feet higher.\\n\\nThe success of my last experiment induced me to try an experiment with\\nmy photographic apparatus. I got it out, and boiled one of my cameras,\\nbut the thing was a failure; it made the wood swell up and burst, and I\\ncould not see that the lenses were any better than they were before.\\n\\nI now concluded to boil a guide. It might improve him, it could not\\nimpair his usefulness. But I was not allowed to proceed. Guides have\\nno feeling for science, and this one would not consent to be made\\nuncomfortable in its interest.\\n\\nIn the midst of my scientific work, one of those needless accidents\\nhappened which are always occurring among the ignorant and thoughtless.\\nA porter shot at a chamois and missed it and crippled the Latinist.\\nThis was not a serious matter to me, for a Latinist\\'s duties are as well\\nperformed on crutches as otherwise--but the fact remained that if the\\nLatinist had not happened to be in the way a mule would have got that\\nload. That would have been quite another matter, for when it comes down\\nto a question of value there is a palpable difference between a Latinist\\nand a mule. I could not depend on having a Latinist in the right place\\nevery time; so, to make things safe, I ordered that in the future the\\nchamois must not be hunted within limits of the camp with any other\\nweapon than the forefinger.\\n\\nMy nerves had hardly grown quiet after this affair when they got another\\nshake-up--one which utterly unmanned me for a moment: a rumor swept\\nsuddenly through the camp that one of the barkeepers had fallen over a\\nprecipice!\\n\\nHowever, it turned out that it was only a chaplain. I had laid in an\\nextra force of chaplains, purposely to be prepared for emergencies\\nlike this, but by some unaccountable oversight had come away rather\\nshort-handed in the matter of barkeepers.\\n\\nOn the following morning we moved on, well refreshed and in good\\nspirits. I remember this day with peculiar pleasure, because it saw\\nour road restored to us. Yes, we found our road again, and in quite an\\nextraordinary way. We had plodded along some two hours and a half, when\\nwe came up against a solid mass of rock about twenty feet high. I did\\nnot need to be instructed by a mule this time. I was already beginning\\nto know more than any mule in the Expedition. I at once put in a blast\\nof dynamite, and lifted that rock out of the way. But to my surprise and\\nmortification, I found that there had been a chalet on top of it.\\n\\nI picked up such members of the family as fell in my vicinity, and\\nsubordinates of my corps collected the rest. None of these poor people\\nwere injured, happily, but they were much annoyed. I explained to\\nthe head chaleteer just how the thing happened, and that I was only\\nsearching for the road, and would certainly have given him timely notice\\nif I had known he was up there. I said I had meant no harm, and hoped\\nI had not lowered myself in his estimation by raising him a few rods in\\nthe air. I said many other judicious things, and finally when I offered\\nto rebuild his chalet, and pay for the breakages, and throw in the\\ncellar, he was mollified and satisfied. He hadn\\'t any cellar at all,\\nbefore; he would not have as good a view, now, as formerly, but what he\\nhad lost in view he had gained in cellar, by exact measurement. He said\\nthere wasn\\'t another hole like that in the mountains--and he would have\\nbeen right if the late mule had not tried to eat up the nitroglycerin.\\n\\nI put a hundred and sixteen men at work, and they rebuilt the chalet\\nfrom its own debris in fifteen minutes. It was a good deal more\\npicturesque than it was before, too. The man said we were now on the\\nFeil-Stutz, above the Schwegmatt--information which I was glad to get,\\nsince it gave us our position to a degree of particularity which we had\\nnot been accustomed to for a day or so. We also learned that we were\\nstanding at the foot of the Riffelberg proper, and that the initial\\nchapter of our work was completed.\\n\\nWe had a fine view, from here, of the energetic Visp, as it makes its\\nfirst plunge into the world from under a huge arch of solid ice, worn\\nthrough the foot-wall of the great Gorner Glacier; and we could also see\\nthe Furggenbach, which is the outlet of the Furggen Glacier.\\n\\nThe mule-road to the summit of the Riffelberg passed right in front of\\nthe chalet, a circumstance which we almost immediately noticed, because\\na procession of tourists was filing along it pretty much all the time.\\n\\n\"Pretty much\" may not be elegant English, but it is high time it was.\\nThere is no elegant word or phrase which means just what it means.--M.T.\\n\\nThe chaleteer\\'s business consisted in furnishing refreshments to\\ntourists. My blast had interrupted this trade for a few minutes, by\\nbreaking all the bottles on the place; but I gave the man a lot of\\nwhiskey to sell for Alpine champagne, and a lot of vinegar which would\\nanswer for Rhine wine, consequently trade was soon as brisk as ever.\\n\\nLeaving the Expedition outside to rest, I quartered myself in the\\nchalet, with Harris, proposing to correct my journals and scientific\\nobservations before continuing the ascent. I had hardly begun my work\\nwhen a tall, slender, vigorous American youth of about twenty-three, who\\nwas on his way down the mountain, entered and came toward me with that\\nbreezy self-complacency which is the adolescent\\'s idea of the well-bred\\nease of the man of the world. His hair was short and parted accurately\\nin the middle, and he had all the look of an American person who would\\nbe likely to begin his signature with an initial, and spell his middle\\nname out. He introduced himself, smiling a smirky smile borrowed from\\nthe courtiers of the stage, extended a fair-skinned talon, and while he\\ngripped my hand in it he bent his body forward three times at the\\nhips, as the stage courtier does, and said in the airiest and most\\ncondescending and patronizing way--I quite remember his exact language:\\n\\n\"Very glad to make your acquaintance, \\'m sure; very glad indeed, assure\\nyou. I\\'ve read all your little efforts and greatly admired them, and\\nwhen I heard you were here, I ...\"\\n\\nI indicated a chair, and he sat down. This grandee was the grandson of\\nan American of considerable note in his day, and not wholly forgotten\\nyet--a man who came so near being a great man that he was quite\\ngenerally accounted one while he lived.\\n\\nI slowly paced the floor, pondering scientific problems, and heard this\\nconversation:\\n\\nGRANDSON. First visit to Europe?\\n\\nHARRIS. Mine? Yes.\\n\\nG.S. (With a soft reminiscent sigh suggestive of bygone joys that may\\nbe tasted in their freshness but once.) Ah, I know what it is to you. A\\nfirst visit!--ah, the romance of it! I wish I could feel it again.\\n\\nH. Yes, I find it exceeds all my dreams. It is enchantment. I go...\\n\\nG.S. (With a dainty gesture of the hand signifying \"Spare me your callow\\nenthusiasms, good friend.\") Yes, _I_ know, I know; you go to cathedrals,\\nand exclaim; and you drag through league-long picture-galleries and\\nexclaim; and you stand here, and there, and yonder, upon historic\\nground, and continue to exclaim; and you are permeated with your first\\ncrude conceptions of Art, and are proud and happy. Ah, yes, proud and\\nhappy--that expresses it. Yes-yes, enjoy it--it is right--it is an\\ninnocent revel.\\n\\nH. And you? Don\\'t you do these things now?\\n\\nG.S. I! Oh, that is _very_ good! My dear sir, when you are as old a\\ntraveler as I am, you will not ask such a question as that. _I_ visit\\nthe regulation gallery, moon around the regulation cathedral, do the\\nworn round of the regulation sights, _yet_?--Excuse me!\\n\\nH. Well, what _do_ you do, then?\\n\\nG.S. Do? I flit--and flit--for I am ever on the wing--but I avoid the\\nherd. Today I am in Paris, tomorrow in Berlin, anon in Rome; but you\\nwould look for me in vain in the galleries of the Louvre or the common\\nresorts of the gazers in those other capitals. If you would find me, you\\nmust look in the unvisited nooks and corners where others never think\\nof going. One day you will find me making myself at home in some obscure\\npeasant\\'s cabin, another day you will find me in some forgotten castle\\nworshiping some little gem or art which the careless eye has overlooked\\nand which the unexperienced would despise; again you will find me as\\nguest in the inner sanctuaries of palaces while the herd is content to\\nget a hurried glimpse of the unused chambers by feeing a servant.\\n\\nH. You are a _guest_ in such places?\\n\\nG.S. And a welcoming one.\\n\\nH. It is surprising. How does it come?\\n\\nG.S. My grandfather\\'s name is a passport to all the courts in Europe. I\\nhave only to utter that name and every door is open to me. I flit from\\ncourt to court at my own free will and pleasure, and am always welcome.\\nI am as much at home in the palaces of Europe as you are among your\\nrelatives. I know every titled person in Europe, I think. I have my\\npockets full of invitations all the time. I am under promise to go to\\nItaly, where I am to be the guest of a succession of the noblest houses\\nin the land. In Berlin my life is a continued round of gaiety in the\\nimperial palace. It is the same, wherever I go.\\n\\nH. It must be very pleasant. But it must make Boston seem a little slow\\nwhen you are at home.\\n\\nG.S. Yes, of course it does. But I don\\'t go home much. There\\'s no life\\nthere--little to feed a man\\'s higher nature. Boston\\'s very narrow, you\\nknow. She doesn\\'t know it, and you couldn\\'t convince her of it--so I say\\nnothing when I\\'m there: where\\'s the use? Yes, Boston is very narrow, but\\nshe has such a good opinion of herself that she can\\'t see it. A man who\\nhas traveled as much as I have, and seen as much of the world, sees it\\nplain enough, but he can\\'t cure it, you know, so the best is to leave it\\nand seek a sphere which is more in harmony with his tastes and culture.\\nI run across there, once a year, perhaps, when I have nothing important\\non hand, but I\\'m very soon back again. I spend my time in Europe.\\n\\nH. I see. You map out your plans and ...\\n\\nG.S. No, excuse me. I don\\'t map out any plans. I simply follow the\\ninclination of the day. I am limited by no ties, no requirements, I\\nam not bound in any way. I am too old a traveler to hamper myself with\\ndeliberate purposes. I am simply a traveler--an inveterate traveler--a\\nman of the world, in a word--I can call myself by no other name. I do\\nnot say, \"I am going here, or I am going there\"--I say nothing at all, I\\nonly act. For instance, next week you may find me the guest of a grandee\\nof Spain, or you may find me off for Venice, or flitting toward Dresden.\\nI shall probably go to Egypt presently; friends will say to friends,\\n\"He is at the Nile cataracts\"--and at that very moment they will be\\nsurprised to learn that I\\'m away off yonder in India somewhere. I am\\na constant surprise to people. They are always saying, \"Yes, he was\\nin Jerusalem when we heard of him last, but goodness knows where he is\\nnow.\"\\n\\nPresently the Grandson rose to leave--discovered he had an appointment\\nwith some Emperor, perhaps. He did his graces over again: gripped me\\nwith one talon, at arm\\'s-length, pressed his hat against his stomach\\nwith the other, bent his body in the middle three times, murmuring:\\n\\n\"Pleasure, \\'m sure; great pleasure, \\'m sure. Wish you much success.\"\\n\\nThen he removed his gracious presence. It is a great and solemn thing to\\nhave a grandfather.\\n\\nI have not purposed to misrepresent this boy in any way, for what little\\nindignation he excited in me soon passed and left nothing behind it but\\ncompassion. One cannot keep up a grudge against a vacuum. I have tried\\nto repeat this lad\\'s very words; if I have failed anywhere I have at\\nleast not failed to reproduce the marrow and meaning of what he said.\\nHe and the innocent chatterbox whom I met on the Swiss lake are the most\\nunique and interesting specimens of Young America I came across\\nduring my foreign tramping. I have made honest portraits of them, not\\ncaricatures.\\n\\nThe Grandson of twenty-three referred to himself five or six times as\\nan \"old traveler,\" and as many as three times (with a serene complacency\\nwhich was maddening) as a \"man of the world.\" There was something very\\ndelicious about his leaving Boston to her \"narrowness,\" unreproved and\\nuninstructed.\\n\\nI formed the caravan in marching order, presently, and after riding down\\nthe line to see that it was properly roped together, gave the command to\\nproceed. In a little while the road carried us to open, grassy land. We\\nwere above the troublesome forest, now, and had an uninterrupted view,\\nstraight before us, of our summit--the summit of the Riffelberg.\\n\\nWe followed the mule-road, a zigzag course, now to the right, now to\\nthe left, but always up, and always crowded and incommoded by going and\\ncoming files of reckless tourists who were never, in a single instance,\\ntied together. I was obliged to exert the utmost care and caution, for\\nin many places the road was not two yards wide, and often the lower side\\nof it sloped away in slanting precipices eight and even nine feet deep.\\nI had to encourage the men constantly, to keep them from giving way to\\ntheir unmanly fears.\\n\\nWe might have made the summit before night, but for a delay caused by\\nthe loss of an umbrella. I was allowing the umbrella to remain lost, but\\nthe men murmured, and with reason, for in this exposed region we stood\\nin peculiar need of protection against avalanches; so I went into camp\\nand detached a strong party to go after the missing article.\\n\\nThe difficulties of the next morning were severe, but our courage\\nwas high, for our goal was near. At noon we conquered the last\\nimpediment--we stood at last upon the summit, and without the loss of a\\nsingle man except the mule that ate the glycerin. Our great achievement\\nwas achieved--the possibility of the impossible was demonstrated, and\\nHarris and I walked proudly into the great dining-room of the Riffelberg\\nHotel and stood our alpenstocks up in the corner.\\n\\nYes, I had made the grand ascent; but it was a mistake to do it in\\nevening dress. The plug hats were battered, the swallow-tails were\\nfluttering rags, mud added no grace, the general effect was unpleasant\\nand even disreputable.\\n\\nThere were about seventy-five tourists at the hotel--mainly ladies and\\nlittle children--and they gave us an admiring welcome which paid us for\\nall our privations and sufferings. The ascent had been made, and the\\nnames and dates now stand recorded on a stone monument there to prove it\\nto all future tourists.\\n\\nI boiled a thermometer and took an altitude, with a most curious result:\\n_the summit was not as high as the point on the mountainside where i\\nhad taken the first altitude_. Suspecting that I had made an important\\ndiscovery, I prepared to verify it. There happened to be a still higher\\nsummit (called the Gorner Grat), above the hotel, and notwithstanding\\nthe fact that it overlooks a glacier from a dizzy height, and that the\\nascent is difficult and dangerous, I resolved to venture up there and\\nboil a thermometer. So I sent a strong party, with some borrowed hoes,\\nin charge of two chiefs of service, to dig a stairway in the soil all\\nthe way up, and this I ascended, roped to the guides. This breezy height\\nwas the summit proper--so I accomplished even more than I had originally\\npurposed to do. This foolhardy exploit is recorded on another stone\\nmonument.\\n\\nI boiled my thermometer, and sure enough, this spot, which purported to\\nbe two thousand feet higher than the locality of the hotel, turned out\\nto be nine thousand feet _lower_. Thus the fact was clearly demonstrated\\nthat, _above a certain point, the higher a point seems to be, the lower\\nit actually is_. Our ascent itself was a great achievement, but this\\ncontribution to science was an inconceivably greater matter.\\n\\nCavilers object that water boils at a lower and lower temperature the\\nhigher and higher you go, and hence the apparent anomaly. I answer that\\nI do not base my theory upon what the boiling water does, but upon what\\na boiled thermometer says. You can\\'t go behind the thermometer.\\n\\nI had a magnificent view of Monte Rosa, and apparently all the rest of\\nthe Alpine world, from that high place. All the circling horizon was\\npiled high with a mighty tumult of snowy crests. One might have\\nimagined he saw before him the tented camps of a beleaguering host of\\nBrobdingnagians.\\n\\nNOTE.--I had the very unusual luck to catch one little momentary\\nglimpse of the Matterhorn wholly unencumbered by clouds. I leveled my\\nphotographic apparatus at it without the loss of an instant, and should\\nhave got an elegant picture if my donkey had not interfered. It was\\nmy purpose to draw this photograph all by myself for my book, but\\nwas obliged to put the mountain part of it into the hands of the\\nprofessional artist because I found I could not do landscape well.\\n\\nBut lonely, conspicuous, and superb, rose that wonderful upright wedge,\\nthe Matterhorn. Its precipitous sides were powdered over with snow, and\\nthe upper half hidden in thick clouds which now and then dissolved to\\ncobweb films and gave brief glimpses of the imposing tower as through a\\nveil. A little later the Matterhorn took to himself the semblance of\\na volcano; he was stripped naked to his apex--around this circled\\nvast wreaths of white cloud which strung slowly out and streamed away\\nslantwise toward the sun, a twenty-mile stretch of rolling and tumbling\\nvapor, and looking just as if it were pouring out of a crater. Later\\nagain, one of the mountain\\'s sides was clean and clear, and another\\nside densely clothed from base to summit in thick smokelike cloud which\\nfeathered off and flew around the shaft\\'s sharp edge like the smoke\\naround the corners of a burning building. The Matterhorn is always\\nexperimenting, and always gets up fine effects, too. In the sunset, when\\nall the lower world is palled in gloom, it points toward heaven out of\\nthe pervading blackness like a finger of fire. In the sunrise--well,\\nthey say it is very fine in the sunrise.\\n\\nAuthorities agree that there is no such tremendous \"layout\" of snowy\\nAlpine magnitude, grandeur, and sublimity to be seen from any other\\naccessible point as the tourist may see from the summit of the\\nRiffelberg. Therefore, let the tourist rope himself up and go there; for\\nI have shown that with nerve, caution, and judgment, the thing can be\\ndone.\\n\\nI wish to add one remark, here--in parentheses, so to speak--suggested\\nby the word \"snowy,\" which I have just used. We have all seen hills and\\nmountains and levels with snow on them, and so we think we know all the\\naspects and effects produced by snow. But indeed we do not until we have\\nseen the Alps. Possibly mass and distance add something--at any\\nrate, something _is_ added. Among other noticeable things, there is a\\ndazzling, intense whiteness about the distant Alpine snow, when the sun\\nis on it, which one recognizes as peculiar, and not familiar to the eye.\\nThe snow which one is accustomed to has a tint to it--painters usually\\ngive it a bluish cast--but there is no perceptible tint to the\\ndistant Alpine snow when it is trying to look its whitest. As to the\\nunimaginable splendor of it when the sun is blazing down on it--well, it\\nsimply _is_ unimaginable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIX\\n\\n[We Travel by Glacier]\\n\\nA guide-book is a queer thing. The reader has just seen what a man who\\nundertakes the great ascent from Zermatt to the Riffelberg Hotel must\\nexperience. Yet Baedeker makes these strange statements concerning this\\nmatter:\\n\\n1. Distance--3 hours. 2. The road cannot be mistaken. 3. Guide\\nunnecessary. 4. Distance from Riffelberg Hotel to the Gorner Grat,\\none hour and a half. 5. Ascent simple and easy. Guide unnecessary.\\n6. Elevation of Zermatt above sea-level, 5,315 feet. 7. Elevation of\\nRiffelberg Hotel above sea-level, 8,429 feet. 8. Elevation of the Gorner\\nGrat above sea-level, 10,289 feet.\\n\\nI have pretty effectually throttled these errors by sending him the\\nfollowing demonstrated facts:\\n\\n1. Distance from Zermatt to Riffelberg Hotel, 7 days. 2. The road _can_\\nbe mistaken. If I am the first that did it, I want the credit of it,\\ntoo. 3. Guides _are_ necessary, for none but a native can read\\nthose finger-boards. 4. The estimate of the elevation of the several\\nlocalities above sea-level is pretty correct--for Baedeker. He only\\nmisses it about a hundred and eighty or ninety thousand feet.\\n\\nI found my arnica invaluable. My men were suffering excruciatingly, from\\nthe friction of sitting down so much. During two or three days, not\\none of them was able to do more than lie down or walk about; yet so\\neffective was the arnica, that on the fourth all were able to sit up.\\nI consider that, more than to anything else, I owe the success of our\\ngreat undertaking to arnica and paregoric.\\n\\nMy men are being restored to health and strength, my main perplexity,\\nnow, was how to get them down the mountain again. I was not willing to\\nexpose the brave fellows to the perils, fatigues, and hardships of that\\nfearful route again if it could be helped. First I thought of balloons;\\nbut, of course, I had to give that idea up, for balloons were\\nnot procurable. I thought of several other expedients, but upon\\nconsideration discarded them, for cause. But at last I hit it. I was\\naware that the movement of glaciers is an established fact, for I had\\nread it in Baedeker; so I resolved to take passage for Zermatt on the\\ngreat Gorner Glacier.\\n\\nVery good. The next thing was, how to get down the glacier\\ncomfortably--for the mule-road to it was long, and winding, and\\nwearisome. I set my mind at work, and soon thought out a plan. One looks\\nstraight down upon the vast frozen river called the Gorner Glacier, from\\nthe Gorner Grat, a sheer precipice twelve hundred feet high. We had\\none hundred and fifty-four umbrellas--and what is an umbrella but a\\nparachute?\\n\\nI mentioned this noble idea to Harris, with enthusiasm, and was about to\\norder the Expedition to form on the Gorner Grat, with their umbrellas,\\nand prepare for flight by platoons, each platoon in command of a guide,\\nwhen Harris stopped me and urged me not to be too hasty. He asked me if\\nthis method of descending the Alps had ever been tried before. I said\\nno, I had not heard of an instance. Then, in his opinion, it was a\\nmatter of considerable gravity; in his opinion it would not be well to\\nsend the whole command over the cliff at once; a better way would be to\\nsend down a single individual, first, and see how he fared.\\n\\nI saw the wisdom in this idea instantly. I said as much, and thanked\\nmy agent cordially, and told him to take his umbrella and try the thing\\nright away, and wave his hat when he got down, if he struck in a soft\\nplace, and then I would ship the rest right along.\\n\\nHarris was greatly touched with this mark of confidence, and said so,\\nin a voice that had a perceptible tremble in it; but at the same time he\\nsaid he did not feel himself worthy of so conspicuous a favor; that it\\nmight cause jealousy in the command, for there were plenty who would not\\nhesitate to say he had used underhanded means to get the appointment,\\nwhereas his conscience would bear him witness that he had not sought it\\nat all, nor even, in his secret heart, desired it.\\n\\nI said these words did him extreme credit, but that he must not throw\\naway the imperishable distinction of being the first man to descend\\nan Alp per parachute, simply to save the feelings of some envious\\nunderlings. No, I said, he _must_ accept the appointment--it was no\\nlonger an invitation, it was a command.\\n\\nHe thanked me with effusion, and said that putting the thing in this\\nform removed every objection. He retired, and soon returned with his\\numbrella, his eye flaming with gratitude and his cheeks pallid with joy.\\nJust then the head guide passed along. Harris\\'s expression changed to\\none of infinite tenderness, and he said:\\n\\n\"That man did me a cruel injury four days ago, and I said in my heart\\nhe should live to perceive and confess that the only noble revenge a\\nman can take upon his enemy is to return good for evil. I resign in his\\nfavor. Appoint him.\"\\n\\nI threw my arms around the generous fellow and said:\\n\\n\"Harris, you are the noblest soul that lives. You shall not regret this\\nsublime act, neither shall the world fail to know of it. You shall have\\nopportunity far transcending this one, too, if I live--remember that.\"\\n\\nI called the head guide to me and appointed him on the spot. But the\\nthing aroused no enthusiasm in him. He did not take to the idea at all.\\n\\nHe said:\\n\\n\"Tie myself to an umbrella and jump over the Gorner Grat! Excuse me,\\nthere are a great many pleasanter roads to the devil than that.\"\\n\\nUpon a discussion of the subject with him, it appeared that he\\nconsidered the project distinctly and decidedly dangerous. I was not\\nconvinced, yet I was not willing to try the experiment in any risky\\nway--that is, in a way that might cripple the strength and efficiency\\nof the Expedition. I was about at my wits\\' end when it occurred to me to\\ntry it on the Latinist.\\n\\nHe was called in. But he declined, on the plea of inexperience,\\ndiffidence in public, lack of curiosity, and I didn\\'t know what all.\\nAnother man declined on account of a cold in the head; thought he ought\\nto avoid exposure. Another could not jump well--never _could_ jump\\nwell--did not believe he could jump so far without long and patient\\npractice. Another was afraid it was going to rain, and his umbrella had\\na hole in it. Everybody had an excuse. The result was what the reader\\nhas by this time guessed: the most magnificent idea that was ever\\nconceived had to be abandoned, from sheer lack of a person with\\nenterprise enough to carry it out. Yes, I actually had to give that\\nthing up--while doubtless I should live to see somebody use it and take\\nall the credit from me.\\n\\nWell, I had to go overland--there was no other way. I marched the\\nExpedition down the steep and tedious mule-path and took up as good a\\nposition as I could upon the middle of the glacier--because Baedeker\\nsaid the middle part travels the fastest. As a measure of economy,\\nhowever, I put some of the heavier baggage on the shoreward parts, to go\\nas slow freight.\\n\\nI waited and waited, but the glacier did not move. Night was coming on,\\nthe darkness began to gather--still we did not budge. It occurred to me\\nthen, that there might be a time-table in Baedeker; it would be well to\\nfind out the hours of starting. I called for the book--it could not be\\nfound. Bradshaw would certainly contain a time-table; but no Bradshaw\\ncould be found.\\n\\nVery well, I must make the best of the situation. So I pitched the\\ntents, picketed the animals, milked the cows, had supper, paregoricked\\nthe men, established the watch, and went to bed--with orders to call me\\nas soon as we came in sight of Zermatt.\\n\\nI awoke about half past ten next morning, and looked around. We hadn\\'t\\nbudged a peg! At first I could not understand it; then it occurred to me\\nthat the old thing must be aground. So I cut down some trees and rigged\\na spar on the starboard and another on the port side, and fooled away\\nupward of three hours trying to spar her off. But it was no use. She\\nwas half a mile wide and fifteen or twenty miles long, and there was\\nno telling just whereabouts she _was_ aground. The men began to show\\nuneasiness, too, and presently they came flying to me with ashy faces,\\nsaying she had sprung a leak.\\n\\nNothing but my cool behavior at this critical time saved us from another\\npanic. I ordered them to show me the place. They led me to a spot where\\na huge boulder lay in a deep pool of clear and brilliant water. It did\\nlook like a pretty bad leak, but I kept that to myself. I made a pump\\nand set the men to work to pump out the glacier. We made a success of\\nit. I perceived, then, that it was not a leak at all. This boulder had\\ndescended from a precipice and stopped on the ice in the middle of the\\nglacier, and the sun had warmed it up, every day, and consequently it\\nhad melted its way deeper and deeper into the ice, until at last it\\nreposed, as we had found it, in a deep pool of the clearest and coldest\\nwater.\\n\\nPresently Baedeker was found again, and I hunted eagerly for the\\ntime-table. There was none. The book simply said the glacier was moving\\nall the time. This was satisfactory, so I shut up the book and chose a\\ngood position to view the scenery as we passed along. I stood there some\\ntime enjoying the trip, but at last it occurred to me that we did\\nnot seem to be gaining any on the scenery. I said to myself, \"This\\nconfounded old thing\\'s aground again, sure,\"--and opened Baedeker to\\nsee if I could run across any remedy for these annoying interruptions.\\nI soon found a sentence which threw a dazzling light upon the matter.\\nIt said, \"The Gorner Glacier travels at an average rate of a little less\\nthan an inch a day.\" I have seldom felt so outraged. I have seldom had\\nmy confidence so wantonly betrayed. I made a small calculation: One inch\\na day, say thirty feet a year; estimated distance to Zermatt, three and\\none-eighteenth miles. Time required to go by glacier, _a little over\\nfive hundred years!_ I said to myself, \"I can _walk_ it quicker--and\\nbefore I will patronize such a fraud as this, I will do it.\"\\n\\nWhen I revealed to Harris the fact that the passenger part of this\\nglacier--the central part--the lightning-express part, so to speak--was\\nnot due in Zermatt till the summer of 2378, and that the baggage, coming\\nalong the slow edge, would not arrive until some generations later, he\\nburst out with:\\n\\n\"That is European management, all over! An inch a day--think of that!\\nFive hundred years to go a trifle over three miles! But I am not a bit\\nsurprised. It\\'s a Catholic glacier. You can tell by the look of it. And\\nthe management.\"\\n\\nI said, no, I believed nothing but the extreme end of it was in a\\nCatholic canton.\\n\\n\"Well, then, it\\'s a government glacier,\" said Harris. \"It\\'s all the\\nsame. Over here the government runs everything--so everything\\'s slow;\\nslow, and ill-managed. But with us, everything\\'s done by private\\nenterprise--and then there ain\\'t much lolling around, you can depend\\non it. I wish Tom Scott could get his hands on this torpid old slab\\nonce--you\\'d see it take a different gait from this.\"\\n\\nI said I was sure he would increase the speed, if there was trade enough\\nto justify it.\\n\\n\"He\\'d _make_ trade,\" said Harris. \"That\\'s the difference between\\ngovernments and individuals. Governments don\\'t care, individuals do. Tom\\nScott would take all the trade; in two years Gorner stock would go to\\ntwo hundred, and inside of two more you would see all the other glaciers\\nunder the hammer for taxes.\" After a reflective pause, Harris added, \"A\\nlittle less than an inch a day; a little less than an _inch_, mind you.\\nWell, I\\'m losing my reverence for glaciers.\"\\n\\nI was feeling much the same way myself. I have traveled by canal-boat,\\nox-wagon, raft, and by the Ephesus and Smyrna railway; but when it comes\\ndown to good solid honest slow motion, I bet my money on the glacier. As\\na means of passenger transportation, I consider the glacier a failure;\\nbut as a vehicle of slow freight, I think she fills the bill. In the\\nmatter of putting the fine shades on that line of business, I judge she\\ncould teach the Germans something.\\n\\nI ordered the men to break camp and prepare for the land journey to\\nZermatt. At this moment a most interesting find was made; a dark object,\\nbedded in the glacial ice, was cut out with the ice-axes, and it proved\\nto be a piece of the undressed skin of some animal--a hair trunk,\\nperhaps; but a close inspection disabled the hair-trunk theory, and\\nfurther discussion and examination exploded it entirely--that is, in the\\nopinion of all the scientists except the one who had advanced it. This\\none clung to his theory with affectionate fidelity characteristic of\\noriginators of scientific theories, and afterward won many of the first\\nscientists of the age to his view, by a very able pamphlet which he\\nwrote, entitled, \"Evidences going to show that the hair trunk, in a wild\\nstate, belonged to the early glacial period, and roamed the wastes of\\nchaos in the company with the cave-bear, primeval man, and the other\\nOoelitics of the Old Silurian family.\"\\n\\nEach of our scientists had a theory of his own, and put forward\\nan animal of his own as a candidate for the skin. I sided with the\\ngeologist of the Expedition in the belief that this patch of skin had\\nonce helped to cover a Siberian elephant, in some old forgotten age--but\\nwe divided there, the geologist believing that this discovery proved\\nthat Siberia had formerly been located where Switzerland is now, whereas\\nI held the opinion that it merely proved that the primeval Swiss was not\\nthe dull savage he is represented to have been, but was a being of high\\nintellectual development, who liked to go to the menagerie.\\n\\nWe arrived that evening, after many hardships and adventures, in some\\nfields close to the great ice-arch where the mad Visp boils and surges\\nout from under the foot of the great Gorner Glacier, and here we camped,\\nour perils over and our magnificent undertaking successfully completed.\\nWe marched into Zermatt the next day, and were received with the\\nmost lavish honors and applause. A document, signed and sealed by the\\nauthorities, was given to me which established and endorsed the fact\\nthat I had made the ascent of the Riffelberg. This I wear around my\\nneck, and it will be buried with me when I am no more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XL\\n\\n[Piteous Relics at Chamonix]\\n\\nI am not so ignorant about glacial movement, now, as I was when I took\\npassage on the Gorner Glacier. I have \"read up\" since. I am aware that\\nthese vast bodies of ice do not travel at the same rate of speed; while\\nthe Gorner Glacier makes less than an inch a day, the Unter-Aar Glacier\\nmakes as much as eight; and still other glaciers are said to go twelve,\\nsixteen, and even twenty inches a day. One writer says that the slowest\\nglacier travels twenty-five feet a year, and the fastest four hundred.\\n\\nWhat is a glacier? It is easy to say it looks like a frozen river which\\noccupies the bed of a winding gorge or gully between mountains. But that\\ngives no notion of its vastness. For it is sometimes six hundred feet\\nthick, and we are not accustomed to rivers six hundred feet deep; no,\\nour rivers are six feet, twenty feet, and sometimes fifty feet deep; we\\nare not quite able to grasp so large a fact as an ice-river six hundred\\nfeet deep.\\n\\nThe glacier\\'s surface is not smooth and level, but has deep swales and\\nswelling elevations, and sometimes has the look of a tossing sea whose\\nturbulent billows were frozen hard in the instant of their most violent\\nmotion; the glacier\\'s surface is not a flawless mass, but is a river\\nwith cracks or crevices, some narrow, some gaping wide. Many a man, the\\nvictim of a slip or a misstep, has plunged down one of these and met his\\ndeath. Men have been fished out of them alive; but it was when they\\ndid not go to a great depth; the cold of the great depths would quickly\\nstupefy a man, whether he was hurt or unhurt. These cracks do not go\\nstraight down; one can seldom see more than twenty to forty feet down\\nthem; consequently men who have disappeared in them have been sought\\nfor, in the hope that they had stopped within helping distance, whereas\\ntheir case, in most instances, had really been hopeless from the\\nbeginning.\\n\\nIn 1864 a party of tourists was descending Mont Blanc, and while picking\\ntheir way over one of the mighty glaciers of that lofty region, roped\\ntogether, as was proper, a young porter disengaged himself from the line\\nand started across an ice-bridge which spanned a crevice. It broke under\\nhim with a crash, and he disappeared. The others could not see how deep\\nhe had gone, so it might be worthwhile to try and rescue him. A brave\\nyoung guide named Michel Payot volunteered.\\n\\nTwo ropes were made fast to his leather belt and he bore the end of a\\nthird one in his hand to tie to the victim in case he found him. He was\\nlowered into the crevice, he descended deeper and deeper between the\\nclear blue walls of solid ice, he approached a bend in the crack and\\ndisappeared under it. Down, and still down, he went, into this profound\\ngrave; when he had reached a depth of eighty feet he passed under\\nanother bend in the crack, and thence descended eighty feet lower, as\\nbetween perpendicular precipices. Arrived at this stage of one hundred\\nand sixty feet below the surface of the glacier, he peered through the\\ntwilight dimness and perceived that the chasm took another turn and\\nstretched away at a steep slant to unknown deeps, for its course was\\nlost in darkness. What a place that was to be in--especially if that\\nleather belt should break! The compression of the belt threatened to\\nsuffocate the intrepid fellow; he called to his friends to draw him up,\\nbut could not make them hear. They still lowered him, deeper and deeper.\\nThen he jerked his third cord as vigorously as he could; his friends\\nunderstood, and dragged him out of those icy jaws of death.\\n\\nThen they attached a bottle to a cord and sent it down two hundred feet,\\nbut it found no bottom. It came up covered with congelations--evidence\\nenough that even if the poor porter reached the bottom with unbroken\\nbones, a swift death from cold was sure, anyway.\\n\\nA glacier is a stupendous, ever-progressing, resistless plow. It pushes\\nahead of it masses of boulders which are packed together, and they\\nstretch across the gorge, right in front of it, like a long grave or a\\nlong, sharp roof. This is called a moraine. It also shoves out a moraine\\nalong each side of its course.\\n\\nImposing as the modern glaciers are, they are not so huge as were some\\nthat once existed. For instance, Mr. Whymper says:\\n\\n\"At some very remote period the Valley of Aosta was occupied by a vast\\nglacier, which flowed down its entire length from Mont Blanc to the\\nplain of Piedmont, remained stationary, or nearly so, at its mouth\\nfor many centuries, and deposited there enormous masses of debris. The\\nlength of this glacier exceeded _eighty miles_, and it drained a\\nbasin twenty-five to thirty-five miles across, bounded by the highest\\nmountains in the Alps.\\n\\n\"The great peaks rose several thousand feet above the glaciers, and\\nthen, as now, shattered by sun and frost, poured down their showers of\\nrocks and stones, in witness of which there are the immense piles of\\nangular fragments that constitute the moraines of Ivrea.\\n\\n\"The moraines around Ivrea are of extraordinary dimensions. That which\\nwas on the left bank of the glacier is about _thirteen miles_ long, and\\nin some places rises to a height of _two thousand one hundred and thirty\\nfeet_ above the floor of the valley! The terminal moraines (those which\\nare pushed in front of the glaciers) cover something like twenty square\\nmiles of country. At the mouth of the Valley of Aosta, the thickness of\\nthe glacier must have been at least _two thousand_ feet, and its width,\\nat that part, _five miles and a quarter._\"\\n\\nIt is not easy to get at a comprehension of a mass of ice like that. If\\none could cleave off the butt end of such a glacier--an oblong block\\ntwo or three miles wide by five and a quarter long and two thousand\\nfeet thick--he could completely hide the city of New York under it,\\nand Trinity steeple would only stick up into it relatively as far as a\\nshingle-nail would stick up into the bottom of a Saratoga trunk.\\n\\n\"The boulders from Mont Blanc, upon the plain below Ivrea, assure us\\nthat the glacier which transported them existed for a prodigious length\\nof time. Their present distance from the cliffs from which they were\\nderived is about 420,000 feet, and if we assume that they traveled at\\nthe rate of 400 feet per annum, their journey must have occupied them no\\nless than 1,055 years! In all probability they did not travel so fast.\"\\n\\nGlaciers are sometimes hurried out of their characteristic snail-pace.\\nA marvelous spectacle is presented then. Mr. Whymper refers to a case\\nwhich occurred in Iceland in 1721:\\n\\n\"It seems that in the neighborhood of the mountain Kotlugja, large\\nbodies of water formed underneath, or within the glaciers (either on\\naccount of the interior heat of the earth, or from other causes), and at\\nlength acquired irresistible power, tore the glaciers from their mooring\\non the land, and swept them over every obstacle into the sea. Prodigious\\nmasses of ice were thus borne for a distance of about ten miles over\\nland in the space of a few hours; and their bulk was so enormous that\\nthey covered the sea for seven miles from the shore, and remained\\naground in six hundred feet of water! The denudation of the land was\\nupon a grand scale. All superficial accumulations were swept away, and\\nthe bedrock was exposed. It was described, in graphic language, how all\\nirregularities and depressions were obliterated, and a smooth surface of\\nseveral miles\\' area laid bare, and that this area had the appearance of\\nhaving been _planed by a plane_.\"\\n\\nThe account translated from the Icelandic says that the mountainlike\\nruins of this majestic glacier so covered the sea that as far as the eye\\ncould reach no open water was discoverable, even from the highest peaks.\\nA monster wall or barrier of ice was built across a considerable stretch\\nof land, too, by this strange irruption:\\n\\n\"One can form some idea of the altitude of this barrier of ice when it\\nis mentioned that from Hofdabrekka farm, which lies high up on a fjeld,\\none could not see Hjorleifshofdi opposite, which is a fell six hundred\\nand forty feet in height; but in order to do so had to clamber up a\\nmountain slope east of Hofdabrekka twelve hundred feet high.\"\\n\\nThese things will help the reader to understand why it is that a man who\\nkeeps company with glaciers comes to feel tolerably insignificant by\\nand by. The Alps and the glaciers together are able to take every bit of\\nconceit out of a man and reduce his self-importance to zero if he will\\nonly remain within the influence of their sublime presence long enough\\nto give it a fair and reasonable chance to do its work.\\n\\nThe Alpine glaciers move--that is granted, now, by everybody. But there\\nwas a time when people scoffed at the idea; they said you might as well\\nexpect leagues of solid rock to crawl along the ground as expect leagues\\nof ice to do it. But proof after proof was furnished, and the finally\\nthe world had to believe.\\n\\nThe wise men not only said the glacier moved, but they timed its\\nmovement. They ciphered out a glacier\\'s gait, and then said confidently\\nthat it would travel just so far in so many years. There is record of\\na striking and curious example of the accuracy which may be attained in\\nthese reckonings.\\n\\nIn 1820 the ascent of Mont Blanc was attempted by a Russian and two\\nEnglishmen, with seven guides. They had reached a prodigious altitude,\\nand were approaching the summit, when an avalanche swept several of the\\nparty down a sharp slope of two hundred feet and hurled five of them\\n(all guides) into one of the crevices of a glacier. The life of one\\nof the five was saved by a long barometer which was strapped to his\\nback--it bridged the crevice and suspended him until help came. The\\nalpenstock or baton of another saved its owner in a similar way. Three\\nmen were lost--Pierre Balmat, Pierre Carrier, and Auguste Tairraz. They\\nhad been hurled down into the fathomless great deeps of the crevice.\\n\\nDr. Forbes, the English geologist, had made frequent visits to the Mont\\nBlanc region, and had given much attention to the disputed question of\\nthe movement of glaciers. During one of these visits he completed his\\nestimates of the rate of movement of the glacier which had swallowed\\nup the three guides, and uttered the prediction that the glacier would\\ndeliver up its dead at the foot of the mountain thirty-five years from\\nthe time of the accident, or possibly forty.\\n\\nA dull, slow journey--a movement imperceptible to any eye--but it was\\nproceeding, nevertheless, and without cessation. It was a journey\\nwhich a rolling stone would make in a few seconds--the lofty point of\\ndeparture was visible from the village below in the valley.\\n\\nThe prediction cut curiously close to the truth; forty-one years after\\nthe catastrophe, the remains were cast forth at the foot of the glacier.\\n\\nI find an interesting account of the matter in the _Histoire Du Mont\\nBlanc_, by Stephen d\\'Arve. I will condense this account, as follows:\\n\\nOn the 12th of August, 1861, at the hour of the close of mass, a guide\\narrived out of breath at the mairie of Chamonix, and bearing on his\\nshoulders a very lugubrious burden. It was a sack filled with human\\nremains which he had gathered from the orifice of a crevice in the\\nGlacier des Bossons. He conjectured that these were remains of the\\nvictims of the catastrophe of 1820, and a minute inquest, immediately\\ninstituted by the local authorities, soon demonstrated the correctness\\nof his supposition. The contents of the sack were spread upon a long\\ntable, and officially inventoried, as follows:\\n\\nPortions of three human skulls. Several tufts of black and blonde hair.\\nA human jaw, furnished with fine white teeth. A forearm and hand, all\\nthe fingers of the latter intact. The flesh was white and fresh,\\nand both the arm and hand preserved a degree of flexibility in the\\narticulations.\\n\\nThe ring-finger had suffered a slight abrasion, and the stain of the\\nblood was still visible and unchanged after forty-one years. A left\\nfoot, the flesh white and fresh.\\n\\nAlong with these fragments were portions of waistcoats, hats, hobnailed\\nshoes, and other clothing; a wing of a pigeon, with black feathers; a\\nfragment of an alpenstock; a tin lantern; and lastly, a boiled leg of\\nmutton, the only flesh among all the remains that exhaled an unpleasant\\nodor. The guide said that the mutton had no odor when he took it from\\nthe glacier; an hour\\'s exposure to the sun had already begun the work of\\ndecomposition upon it.\\n\\nPersons were called for, to identify these poor pathetic relics, and a\\ntouching scene ensued. Two men were still living who had witnessed the\\ngrim catastrophe of nearly half a century before--Marie Couttet (saved\\nby his baton) and Julien Davouassoux (saved by the barometer). These\\naged men entered and approached the table. Davouassoux, more than eighty\\nyears old, contemplated the mournful remains mutely and with a vacant\\neye, for his intelligence and his memory were torpid with age; but\\nCouttet\\'s faculties were still perfect at seventy-two, and he exhibited\\nstrong emotion. He said:\\n\\n\"Pierre Balmat was fair; he wore a straw hat. This bit of skull, with\\nthe tuft of blond hair, was his; this is his hat. Pierre Carrier was\\nvery dark; this skull was his, and this felt hat. This is Balmat\\'s\\nhand, I remember it so well!\" and the old man bent down and kissed it\\nreverently, then closed his fingers upon it in an affectionate grasp,\\ncrying out, \"I could never have dared to believe that before quitting\\nthis world it would be granted me to press once more the hand of one of\\nthose brave comrades, the hand of my good friend Balmat.\"\\n\\nThere is something weirdly pathetic about the picture of that\\nwhite-haired veteran greeting with his loving handshake this friend\\nwho had been dead forty years. When these hands had met last, they were\\nalike in the softness and freshness of youth; now, one was brown and\\nwrinkled and horny with age, while the other was still as young and fair\\nand blemishless as if those forty years had come and gone in a single\\nmoment, leaving no mark of their passage. Time had gone on, in the one\\ncase; it had stood still in the other. A man who has not seen a friend\\nfor a generation, keeps him in mind always as he saw him last, and is\\nsomehow surprised, and is also shocked, to see the aging change the\\nyears have wrought when he sees him again. Marie Couttet\\'s experience,\\nin finding his friend\\'s hand unaltered from the image of it which he\\nhad carried in his memory for forty years, is an experience which stands\\nalone in the history of man, perhaps.\\n\\nCouttet identified other relics:\\n\\n\"This hat belonged to Auguste Tairraz. He carried the cage of pigeons\\nwhich we proposed to set free upon the summit. Here is the wing of one\\nof those pigeons. And here is the fragment of my broken baton; it was by\\ngrace of that baton that my life was saved. Who could have told me that\\nI should one day have the satisfaction to look again upon this bit of\\nwood that supported me above the grave that swallowed up my unfortunate\\ncompanions!\"\\n\\nNo portions of the body of Tairraz, other than a piece of the skull,\\nhad been found. A diligent search was made, but without result. However,\\nanother search was instituted a year later, and this had better success.\\nMany fragments of clothing which had belonged to the lost guides were\\ndiscovered; also, part of a lantern, and a green veil with blood-stains\\non it. But the interesting feature was this:\\n\\nOne of the searchers came suddenly upon a sleeved arm projecting from\\na crevice in the ice-wall, with the hand outstretched as if offering\\ngreeting! \"The nails of this white hand were still rosy, and the pose\\nof the extended fingers seemed to express an eloquent welcome to the\\nlong-lost light of day.\"\\n\\nThe hand and arm were alone; there was no trunk. After being removed\\nfrom the ice the flesh-tints quickly faded out and the rosy nails took\\non the alabaster hue of death. This was the third _right_ hand found;\\ntherefore, all three of the lost men were accounted for, beyond cavil or\\nquestion.\\n\\nDr. Hamel was the Russian gentleman of the party which made the ascent\\nat the time of the famous disaster. He left Chamonix as soon as he\\nconveniently could after the descent; and as he had shown a chilly\\nindifference about the calamity, and offered neither sympathy nor\\nassistance to the widows and orphans, he carried with him the cordial\\nexecrations of the whole community. Four months before the first remains\\nwere found, a Chamonix guide named Balmat--a relative of one of the lost\\nmen--was in London, and one day encountered a hale old gentleman in the\\nBritish Museum, who said:\\n\\n\"I overheard your name. Are you from Chamonix, Monsieur Balmat?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"Haven\\'t they found the bodies of my three guides, yet? I am Dr. Hamel.\"\\n\\n\"Alas, no, monsieur.\"\\n\\n\"Well, you\\'ll find them, sooner or later.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, it is the opinion of Dr. Forbes and Mr. Tyndall, that the glacier\\nwill sooner or later restore to us the remains of the unfortunate\\nvictims.\"\\n\\n\"Without a doubt, without a doubt. And it will be a great thing for\\nChamonix, in the matter of attracting tourists. You can get up a museum\\nwith those remains that will draw!\"\\n\\nThis savage idea has not improved the odor of Dr. Hamel\\'s name in\\nChamonix by any means. But after all, the man was sound on human nature.\\nHis idea was conveyed to the public officials of Chamonix, and they\\ngravely discussed it around the official council-table. They were only\\nprevented from carrying it into execution by the determined opposition\\nof the friends and descendants of the lost guides, who insisted on\\ngiving the remains Christian burial, and succeeded in their purpose.\\n\\nA close watch had to be kept upon all the poor remnants and fragments,\\nto prevent embezzlement. A few accessory odds and ends were sold. Rags\\nand scraps of the coarse clothing were parted with at the rate equal to\\nabout twenty dollars a yard; a piece of a lantern and one or two other\\ntrifles brought nearly their weight in gold; and an Englishman offered a\\npound sterling for a single breeches-button.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLI\\n\\n[The Fearful Disaster of 1865]\\n\\nOne of the most memorable of all the Alpine catastrophes was that of\\nJuly, 1865, on the Matterhorn--already slightly referred to, a few\\npages back. The details of it are scarcely known in America. To the vast\\nmajority of readers they are not known at all. Mr. Whymper\\'s account is\\nthe only authentic one. I will import the chief portion of it into this\\nbook, partly because of its intrinsic interest, and partly because it\\ngives such a vivid idea of what the perilous pastime of Alp-climbing\\nis. This was Mr. Whymper\\'s _ninth_ attempt during a series of years, to\\nvanquish that steep and stubborn pillar or rock; it succeeded, the other\\neight were failures. No man had ever accomplished the ascent before,\\nthough the attempts had been numerous.\\n\\nMR. WHYMPER\\'S NARRATIVE\\n\\nWe started from Zermatt on the 13th of July, at half past five, on a\\nbrilliant and perfectly cloudless morning. We were eight in number--Croz\\n(guide), old Peter Taugwalder (guide) and his two sons; Lord F. Douglas,\\nMr. Hadow, Rev. Mr. Hudson, and I. To insure steady motion, one tourist\\nand one native walked together. The youngest Taugwalder fell to my\\nshare. The wine-bags also fell to my lot to carry, and throughout the\\nday, after each drink, I replenished them secretly with water, so that\\nat the next halt they were found fuller than before! This was considered\\na good omen, and little short of miraculous.\\n\\nOn the first day we did not intend to ascend to any great height, and we\\nmounted, accordingly, very leisurely. Before twelve o\\'clock we had found\\na good position for the tent, at a height of eleven thousand feet. We\\npassed the remaining hours of daylight--some basking in the sunshine,\\nsome sketching, some collecting; Hudson made tea, I coffee, and at\\nlength we retired, each one to his blanket bag.\\n\\nWe assembled together before dawn on the 14th and started directly\\nit was light enough to move. One of the young Taugwalders returned to\\nZermatt. In a few minutes we turned the rib which had intercepted the\\nview of the eastern face from our tent platform. The whole of this\\ngreat slope was now revealed, rising for three thousand feet like a huge\\nnatural staircase. Some parts were more, and others were less easy, but\\nwe were not once brought to a halt by any serious impediment, for when\\nan obstruction was met in front it could always be turned to the right\\nor to the left. For the greater part of the way there was no occasion,\\nindeed, for the rope, and sometimes Hudson led, sometimes myself. At\\nsix-twenty we had attained a height of twelve thousand eight hundred\\nfeet, and halted for half an hour; we then continued the ascent without\\na break until nine-fifty-five, when we stopped for fifty minutes, at a\\nheight of fourteen thousand feet.\\n\\nWe had now arrived at the foot of that part which, seen from the\\nRiffelberg, seems perpendicular or overhanging. We could no longer\\ncontinue on the eastern side. For a little distance we ascended by snow\\nupon the _arte_--that is, the ridge--then turned over to the right, or\\nnorthern side. The work became difficult, and required caution. In some\\nplaces there was little to hold; the general slope of the mountain was\\n_less_ than forty degrees, and snow had accumulated in, and had filled\\nup, the interstices of the rock-face, leaving only occasional fragments\\nprojecting here and there. These were at times covered with a thin film\\nof ice. It was a place which any fair mountaineer might pass in safety.\\nWe bore away nearly horizontally for about four hundred feet, then\\nascended directly toward the summit for about sixty feet, then doubled\\nback to the ridge which descends toward Zermatt. A long stride round\\na rather awkward corner brought us to snow once more. That last doubt\\nvanished! The Matterhorn was ours! Nothing but two hundred feet of easy\\nsnow remained to be surmounted.\\n\\nThe higher we rose, the more intense became the excitement. The slope\\neased off, at length we could be detached, and Croz and I, dashed away,\\nran a neck-and-neck race, which ended in a dead heat. At 1:40 P.M., the\\nworld was at our feet, and the Matterhorn was conquered!\\n\\nThe others arrived. Croz now took the tent-pole, and planted it in the\\nhighest snow. \"Yes,\" we said, \"there is the flag-staff, but where is the\\nflag?\" \"Here it is,\" he answered, pulling off his blouse and fixing it\\nto the stick. It made a poor flag, and there was no wind to float\\nit out, yet it was seen all around. They saw it at Zermatt--at the\\nRiffel--in the Val Tournanche... .\\n\\nWe remained on the summit for one hour--\\n\\nOne crowded hour of glorious life.\\n\\nIt passed away too quickly, and we began to prepare for the descent.\\n\\nHudson and I consulted as to the best and safest arrangement of the\\nparty. We agreed that it was best for Croz to go first, and Hadow\\nsecond; Hudson, who was almost equal to a guide in sureness of foot,\\nwished to be third; Lord Douglas was placed next, and old Peter, the\\nstrongest of the remainder, after him. I suggested to Hudson that we\\nshould attach a rope to the rocks on our arrival at the difficult bit,\\nand hold it as we descended, as an additional protection. He approved\\nthe idea, but it was not definitely decided that it should be done. The\\nparty was being arranged in the above order while I was sketching the\\nsummit, and they had finished, and were waiting for me to be tied in\\nline, when some one remembered that our names had not been left in a\\nbottle. They requested me to write them down, and moved off while it was\\nbeing done.\\n\\nA few minutes afterward I tied myself to young Peter, ran down after the\\nothers, and caught them just as they were commencing the descent of the\\ndifficult part. Great care was being taken. Only one man was moving at a\\ntime; when he was firmly planted the next advanced, and so on. They had\\nnot, however, attached the additional rope to rocks, and nothing was\\nsaid about it. The suggestion was not made for my own sake, and I am not\\nsure that it ever occurred to me again. For some little distance we two\\nfollowed the others, detached from them, and should have continued so\\nhad not Lord Douglas asked me, about 3 P.M., to tie on to old Peter, as\\nhe feared, he said, that Taugwalder would not be able to hold his ground\\nif a slip occurred.\\n\\nA few minutes later, a sharp-eyed lad ran into the Monte Rosa Hotel, at\\nZermatt, saying that he had seen an avalanche fall from the summit of\\nthe Matterhorn onto the Matterhorn glacier. The boy was reproved for\\ntelling idle stories; he was right, nevertheless, and this was what he\\nsaw.\\n\\nMichel Croz had laid aside his ax, and in order to give Mr. Hadow\\ngreater security, was absolutely taking hold of his legs, and putting\\nhis feet, one by one, into their proper positions. As far as I know, no\\none was actually descending. I cannot speak with certainty, because the\\ntwo leading men were partially hidden from my sight by an intervening\\nmass of rock, but it is my belief, from the movements of their\\nshoulders, that Croz, having done as I said, was in the act of turning\\nround to go down a step or two himself; at this moment Mr. Hadow\\nslipped, fell against him, and knocked him over. I heard one startled\\nexclamation from Croz, then saw him and Mr. Hadow flying downward;\\nin another moment Hudson was dragged from his steps, and Lord Douglas\\nimmediately after him. All this was the work of a moment. Immediately we\\nheard Croz\\'s exclamation, old Peter and I planted ourselves as firmly as\\nthe rocks would permit; the rope was taut between us, and the jerk came\\non us both as on one man. We held; but the rope broke midway between\\nTaugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas. For a few seconds we saw our\\nunfortunate companions sliding downward on their backs, and spreading\\nout their hands, endeavoring to save themselves. They passed from our\\nsight uninjured, disappeared one by one, and fell from the precipice to\\nprecipice onto the Matterhorn glacier below, a distance of nearly\\nfour thousand feet in height. From the moment the rope broke it was\\nimpossible to help them. So perished our comrades!\\n\\nFor more than two hours afterward I thought almost every moment that the\\nnext would be my last; for the Taugwalders, utterly unnerved, were not\\nonly incapable of giving assistance, but were in such a state that a\\nslip might have been expected from them at any moment. After a time we\\nwere able to do that which should have been done at first, and fixed\\nrope to firm rocks, in addition to being tied together. These ropes were\\ncut from time to time, and were left behind. Even with their assurance\\nthe men were afraid to proceed, and several times old Peter turned, with\\nashy face and faltering limbs, and said, with terrible emphasis, \"_I\\ncannot_!\"\\n\\nAbout 6 P.M., we arrived at the snow upon the ridge descending toward\\nZermatt, and all peril was over. We frequently looked, but in vain, for\\ntraces of our unfortunate companions; we bent over the ridge and cried\\nto them, but no sound returned. Convinced at last that they were neither\\nwithin sight nor hearing, we ceased from our useless efforts; and, too\\ncast down for speech, silently gathered up our things, and the little\\neffects of those who were lost, and then completed the descent.\\n\\nSuch is Mr. Whymper\\'s graphic and thrilling narrative. Zermatt gossip\\ndarkly hints that the elder Taugwalder cut the rope, when the accident\\noccurred, in order to preserve himself from being dragged into the\\nabyss; but Mr. Whymper says that the ends of the rope showed no evidence\\nof cutting, but only of breaking. He adds that if Taugwalder had had the\\ndisposition to cut the rope, he would not have had time to do it, the\\naccident was so sudden and unexpected.\\n\\nLord Douglas\\' body has never been found. It probably lodged upon some\\ninaccessible shelf in the face of the mighty precipice. Lord Douglas was\\na youth of nineteen. The three other victims fell nearly four thousand\\nfeet, and their bodies lay together upon the glacier when found by\\nMr. Whymper and the other searchers the next morning. Their graves are\\nbeside the little church in Zermatt.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLII\\n\\n[Chillon has a Nice, Roomy Dungeon]\\n\\nSwitzerland is simply a large, humpy, solid rock, with a thin skin of\\ngrass stretched over it. Consequently, they do not dig graves, they\\nblast them out with powder and fuse. They cannot afford to have large\\ngraveyards, the grass skin is too circumscribed and too valuable. It is\\nall required for the support of the living.\\n\\nThe graveyard in Zermatt occupies only about one-eighth of an acre.\\nThe graves are sunk in the living rock, and are very permanent; but\\noccupation of them is only temporary; the occupant can only stay till\\nhis grave is needed by a later subject, he is removed, then, for they do\\nnot bury one body on top of another. As I understand it, a family owns\\na grave, just as it owns a house. A man dies and leaves his house to his\\nson--and at the same time, this dead father succeeds to his own father\\'s\\ngrave. He moves out of the house and into the grave, and his predecessor\\nmoves out of the grave and into the cellar of the chapel. I saw a black\\nbox lying in the churchyard, with skull and cross-bones painted on it,\\nand was told that this was used in transferring remains to the cellar.\\n\\nIn that cellar the bones and skulls of several hundred of former\\ncitizens were compactly corded up. They made a pile eighteen feet long,\\nseven feet high, and eight feet wide. I was told that in some of the\\nreceptacles of this kind in the Swiss villages, the skulls were all\\nmarked, and if a man wished to find the skulls of his ancestors for\\nseveral generations back, he could do it by these marks, preserved in\\nthe family records.\\n\\nAn English gentleman who had lived some years in this region, said it\\nwas the cradle of compulsory education. But he said that the English\\nidea that compulsory education would reduce bastardy and intemperance\\nwas an error--it has not that effect. He said there was more seduction\\nin the Protestant than in the Catholic cantons, because the confessional\\nprotected the girls. I wonder why it doesn\\'t protect married women in\\nFrance and Spain?\\n\\nThis gentleman said that among the poorer peasants in the Valais, it was\\ncommon for the brothers in a family to cast lots to determine which\\nof them should have the coveted privilege of marrying, and his\\nbrethren--doomed bachelors--heroically banded themselves together to\\nhelp support the new family.\\n\\nWe left Zermatt in a wagon--and in a rain-storm, too--for St. Nicholas\\nabout ten o\\'clock one morning. Again we passed between those grass-clad\\nprodigious cliffs, specked with wee dwellings peeping over at us from\\nvelvety green walls ten and twelve hundred feet high. It did not seem\\npossible that the imaginary chamois even could climb those precipices.\\nLovers on opposite cliffs probably kiss through a spy-glass, and\\ncorrespond with a rifle.\\n\\nIn Switzerland the farmer\\'s plow is a wide shovel, which scrapes up and\\nturns over the thin earthy skin of his native rock--and there the man of\\nthe plow is a hero. Now here, by our St. Nicholas road, was a grave, and\\nit had a tragic story. A plowman was skinning his farm one morning--not\\nthe steepest part of it, but still a steep part--that is, he was not\\nskinning the front of his farm, but the roof of it, near the eaves--when\\nhe absent-mindedly let go of the plow-handles to moisten his hands, in\\nthe usual way; he lost his balance and fell out of his farm backward;\\npoor fellow, he never touched anything till he struck bottom, fifteen\\nhundred feet below. [This was on a Sunday.--M.T.] We throw a halo of\\nheroism around the life of the soldier and the sailor, because of the\\ndeadly dangers they are facing all the time. But we are not used to\\nlooking upon farming as a heroic occupation. This is because we have not\\nlived in Switzerland.\\n\\nFrom St. Nicholas we struck out for Visp--or Vispach--on foot. The\\nrain-storms had been at work during several days, and had done a deal of\\ndamage in Switzerland and Savoy. We came to one place where a stream had\\nchanged its course and plunged down a mountain in a new place, sweeping\\neverything before it. Two poor but precious farms by the roadside were\\nruined. One was washed clear away, and the bed-rock exposed; the other\\nwas buried out of sight under a tumbled chaos of rocks, gravel, mud,\\nand rubbish. The resistless might of water was well exemplified. Some\\nsaplings which had stood in the way were bent to the ground, stripped\\nclean of their bark, and buried under rocky debris. The road had been\\nswept away, too.\\n\\nIn another place, where the road was high up on the mountain\\'s face, and\\nits outside edge protected by flimsy masonry, we frequently came across\\nspots where this masonry had carved off and left dangerous gaps for\\nmules to get over; and with still more frequency we found the masonry\\nslightly crumbled, and marked by mule-hoofs, thus showing that there had\\nbeen danger of an accident to somebody. When at last we came to a\\nbadly ruptured bit of masonry, with hoof-prints evidencing a desperate\\nstruggle to regain the lost foothold, I looked quite hopefully over the\\ndizzy precipice. But there was nobody down there.\\n\\nThey take exceedingly good care of their rivers in Switzerland and other\\nportions of Europe. They wall up both banks with slanting solid stone\\nmasonry--so that from end to end of these rivers the banks look like the\\nwharves at St. Louis and other towns on the Mississippi River.\\n\\nIt was during this walk from St. Nicholas, in the shadow of the majestic\\nAlps, that we came across some little children amusing themselves in\\nwhat seemed, at first, a most odd and original way--but it wasn\\'t; it\\nwas in simply a natural and characteristic way. They were roped together\\nwith a string, they had mimic alpenstocks and ice-axes, and were\\nclimbing a meek and lowly manure-pile with a most blood-curdling amount\\nof care and caution. The \"guide\" at the head of the line cut imaginary\\nsteps, in a laborious and painstaking way, and not a monkey budged till\\nthe step above was vacated. If we had waited we should have witnessed an\\nimaginary accident, no doubt; and we should have heard the intrepid band\\nhurrah when they made the summit and looked around upon the \"magnificent\\nview,\" and seen them throw themselves down in exhausted attitudes for a\\nrest in that commanding situation.\\n\\nIn Nevada I used to see the children play at silver-mining. Of course,\\nthe great thing was an accident in a mine, and there were two \"star\"\\nparts; that of the man who fell down the mimic shaft, and that of the\\ndaring hero who was lowered into the depths to bring him up. I knew one\\nsmall chap who always insisted on playing _both_ of these parts--and he\\ncarried his point. He would tumble into the shaft and die, and then come\\nto the surface and go back after his own remains.\\n\\nIt is the smartest boy that gets the hero part everywhere; he is head\\nguide in Switzerland, head miner in Nevada, head bull-fighter in Spain,\\netc.; but I knew a preacher\\'s son, seven years old, who once selected\\na part for himself compared to which those just mentioned are tame\\nand unimpressive. Jimmy\\'s father stopped him from driving imaginary\\nhorse-cars one Sunday--stopped him from playing captain of an imaginary\\nsteamboat next Sunday--stopped him from leading an imaginary army to\\nbattle the following Sunday--and so on. Finally the little fellow said:\\n\\n\"I\\'ve tried everything, and they won\\'t any of them do. What _can_ I\\nplay?\"\\n\\n\"I hardly know, Jimmy; but you _must_ play only things that are suitable\\nto the Sabbath-day.\"\\n\\nNext Sunday the preacher stepped softly to a back-room door to see if\\nthe children were rightly employed. He peeped in. A chair occupied the\\nmiddle of the room, and on the back of it hung Jimmy\\'s cap; one of\\nhis little sisters took the cap down, nibbled at it, then passed it to\\nanother small sister and said, \"Eat of this fruit, for it is good.\" The\\nReverend took in the situation--alas, they were playing the Expulsion\\nfrom Eden! Yet he found one little crumb of comfort. He said to himself,\\n\"For once Jimmy has yielded the chief role--I have been wronging him, I\\ndid not believe there was so much modesty in him; I should have expected\\nhim to be either Adam or Eve.\" This crumb of comfort lasted but a very\\nlittle while; he glanced around and discovered Jimmy standing in an\\nimposing attitude in a corner, with a dark and deadly frown on his face.\\nWhat that meant was very plain--_he was impersonating the deity_! Think\\nof the guileless sublimity of that idea.\\n\\nWe reached Vispach at 8 P.M., only about seven hours out from St.\\nNicholas. So we must have made fully a mile and a half an hour, and it\\nwas all downhill, too, and very muddy at that. We stayed all night at\\nthe Hotel de Soleil; I remember it because the landlady, the portier,\\nthe waitress, and the chambermaid were not separate persons, but were\\nall contained in one neat and chipper suit of spotless muslin, and she\\nwas the prettiest young creature I saw in all that region. She was the\\nlandlord\\'s daughter. And I remember that the only native match to her\\nI saw in all Europe was the young daughter of the landlord of a village\\ninn in the Black Forest. Why don\\'t more people in Europe marry and keep\\nhotel?\\n\\nNext morning we left with a family of English friends and went by train\\nto Brevet, and thence by boat across the lake to Ouchy (Lausanne).\\n\\nOuchy is memorable to me, not on account of its beautiful situation and\\nlovely surroundings--although these would make it stick long in one\\'s\\nmemory--but as the place where _I_ caught the London _Times_ dropping\\ninto humor. It was _not_ aware of it, though. It did not do it on\\npurpose. An English friend called my attention to this lapse, and cut\\nout the reprehensible paragraph for me. Think of encountering a grin\\nlike this on the face of that grim journal:\\n\\n_Erratum_.--We are requested by Reuter\\'s Telegram Company to correct an\\nerroneous announcement made in their Brisbane telegram of the 2d inst.,\\npublished in our impression of the 5th inst., stating that \"Lady Kennedy\\nhad given birth to twins, the eldest being a son.\" The Company explain\\nthat the message they received contained the words \"Governor of\\nQueensland, _twins first son_.\" Being, however, subsequently informed\\nthat Sir Arthur Kennedy was unmarried and that there must be some\\nmistake, a telegraphic repetition was at once demanded. It has been\\nreceived today (11th inst.) and shows that the words really telegraphed\\nby Reuter\\'s agent were \"Governor Queensland _turns first sod_,\" alluding\\nto the Maryborough-Gympic Railway in course of construction. The\\nwords in italics were mutilated by the telegraph in transmission from\\nAustralia, and reaching the company in the form mentioned above gave\\nrise to the mistake.\\n\\nI had always had a deep and reverent compassion for the sufferings of\\nthe \"prisoner of Chillon,\" whose story Byron had told in such moving\\nverse; so I took the steamer and made pilgrimage to the dungeons of the\\nCastle of Chillon, to see the place where poor Bonnivard endured his\\ndreary captivity three hundred years ago. I am glad I did that, for it\\ntook away some of the pain I was feeling on the prisoner\\'s account. His\\ndungeon was a nice, cool, roomy place, and I cannot see why he should\\nhave been dissatisfied with it. If he had been imprisoned in a St.\\nNicholas private dwelling, where the fertilizer prevails, and the goat\\nsleeps with the guest, and the chickens roost on him and the cow comes\\nin and bothers him when he wants to muse, it would have been another\\nmatter altogether; but he surely could not have had a very cheerless\\ntime of it in that pretty dungeon. It has romantic window-slits that\\nlet in generous bars of light, and it has tall, noble columns, carved\\napparently from the living rock; and what is more, they are written\\nall over with thousands of names; some of them--like Byron\\'s and Victor\\nHugo\\'s--of the first celebrity. Why didn\\'t he amuse himself reading\\nthese names? Then there are the couriers and tourists--swarms of them\\nevery day--what was to hinder him from having a good time with them? I\\nthink Bonnivard\\'s sufferings have been overrated.\\n\\nNext, we took the train and went to Martigny, on the way to Mont Blanc.\\nNext morning we started, about eight o\\'clock, on foot. We had plenty of\\ncompany, in the way of wagon-loads and mule-loads of tourists--and dust.\\nThis scattering procession of travelers was perhaps a mile long. The\\nroad was uphill--interminable uphill--and tolerably steep. The weather\\nwas blisteringly hot, and the man or woman who had to sit on a creeping\\nmule, or in a crawling wagon, and broil in the beating sun, was an\\nobject to be pitied. We could dodge among the bushes, and have the\\nrelief of shade, but those people could not. They paid for a conveyance,\\nand to get their money\\'s worth they rode.\\n\\nWe went by the way of the Tte Noir, and after we reached high ground\\nthere was no lack of fine scenery. In one place the road was tunneled\\nthrough a shoulder of the mountain; from there one looked down into a\\ngorge with a rushing torrent in it, and on every hand was a charming\\nview of rocky buttresses and wooded heights. There was a liberal\\nallowance of pretty waterfalls, too, on the Tte Noir route.\\n\\nAbout half an hour before we reached the village of Argentire a vast\\ndome of snow with the sun blazing on it drifted into view and framed\\nitself in a strong V-shaped gateway of the mountains, and we recognized\\nMont Blanc, the \"monarch of the Alps.\" With every step, after that,\\nthis stately dome rose higher and higher into the blue sky, and at last\\nseemed to occupy the zenith.\\n\\nSome of Mont Blanc\\'s neighbors--bare, light-brown, steeplelike\\nrocks--were very peculiarly shaped. Some were whittled to a sharp point,\\nand slightly bent at the upper end, like a lady\\'s finger; one monster\\nsugar-loaf resembled a bishop\\'s hat; it was too steep to hold snow on\\nits sides, but had some in the division.\\n\\nWhile we were still on very high ground, and before the descent toward\\nArgentire began, we looked up toward a neighboring mountain-top, and\\nsaw exquisite prismatic colors playing about some white clouds which\\nwere so delicate as to almost resemble gossamer webs. The faint pinks\\nand greens were peculiarly beautiful; none of the colors were deep, they\\nwere the lightest shades. They were bewitching commingled. We sat down\\nto study and enjoy this singular spectacle. The tints remained during\\nseveral minutes--flitting, changing, melting into each other; paling\\nalmost away for a moment, then reflushing--a shifting, restless,\\nunstable succession of soft opaline gleams, shimmering over that air\\nfilm of white cloud, and turning it into a fabric dainty enough to\\nclothe an angel with.\\n\\nBy and by we perceived what those super-delicate colors, and their\\ncontinuous play and movement, reminded us of; it is what one sees in a\\nsoap-bubble that is drifting along, catching changes of tint from the\\nobjects it passes. A soap-bubble is the most beautiful thing, and the\\nmost exquisite, in nature; that lovely phantom fabric in the sky was\\nsuggestive of a soap-bubble split open, and spread out in the sun. I\\nwonder how much it would take to buy a soap-bubble, if there was only\\none in the world? One could buy a hatful of Koh-i-Noors with the same\\nmoney, no doubt.\\n\\nWe made the tramp from Martigny to Argentie`re in eight hours. We beat\\nall the mules and wagons; we didn\\'t usually do that. We hired a sort of\\nopen baggage-wagon for the trip down the valley to Chamonix, and then\\ndevoted an hour to dining. This gave the driver time to get drunk. He\\nhad a friend with him, and this friend also had had time to get drunk.\\n\\nWhen we drove off, the driver said all the tourists had arrived and\\ngone by while we were at dinner; \"but,\" said he, impressively, \"be not\\ndisturbed by that--remain tranquil--give yourselves no uneasiness--their\\ndust rises far before us--rest you tranquil, leave all to me--I am the\\nking of drivers. Behold!\"\\n\\nDown came his whip, and away we clattered. I never had such a shaking up\\nin my life. The recent flooding rains had washed the road clear away in\\nplaces, but we never stopped, we never slowed down for anything. We tore\\nright along, over rocks, rubbish, gullies, open fields--sometimes with\\none or two wheels on the ground, but generally with none. Every now and\\nthen that calm, good-natured madman would bend a majestic look over his\\nshoulder at us and say, \"Ah, you perceive? It is as I have said--I am\\nthe king of drivers.\" Every time we just missed going to destruction,\\nhe would say, with tranquil happiness, \"Enjoy it, gentlemen, it is very\\nrare, it is very unusual--it is given to few to ride with the king of\\ndrivers--and observe, it is as I have said, I am he.\"\\n\\nHe spoke in French, and punctuated with hiccoughs. His friend was\\nFrench, too, but spoke in German--using the same system of punctuation,\\nhowever. The friend called himself the \"Captain of Mont Blanc,\" and\\nwanted us to make the ascent with him. He said he had made more ascents\\nthan any other man--forty seven--and his brother had made thirty-seven.\\nHis brother was the best guide in the world, except himself--but he,\\nyes, observe him well--he was the \"Captain of Mont Blanc\"--that title\\nbelonged to none other.\\n\\nThe \"king\" was as good as his word--he overtook that long procession\\nof tourists and went by it like a hurricane. The result was that we got\\nchoicer rooms at the hotel in Chamonix than we should have done if\\nhis majesty had been a slower artist--or rather, if he hadn\\'t most\\nprovidentially got drunk before he left Argentie`re.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIII\\n\\n[My Poor Sick Friend Disappointed]\\n\\nEverybody was out-of-doors; everybody was in the principal street of the\\nvillage--not on the sidewalks, but all over the street; everybody was\\nlounging, loafing, chatting, waiting, alert, expectant, interested--for\\nit was train-time. That is to say, it was diligence-time--the half-dozen\\nbig diligences would soon be arriving from Geneva, and the village was\\ninterested, in many ways, in knowing how many people were coming and\\nwhat sort of folk they might be. It was altogether the livest-looking\\nstreet we had seen in any village on the continent.\\n\\nThe hotel was by the side of a booming torrent, whose music was loud\\nand strong; we could not see this torrent, for it was dark, now, but\\none could locate it without a light. There was a large enclosed yard in\\nfront of the hotel, and this was filled with groups of villagers waiting\\nto see the diligences arrive, or to hire themselves to excursionists for\\nthe morrow. A telescope stood in the yard, with its huge barrel canted\\nup toward the lustrous evening star. The long porch of the hotel was\\npopulous with tourists, who sat in shawls and wraps under the vast\\novershadowing bulk of Mont Blanc, and gossiped or meditated.\\n\\nNever did a mountain seem so close; its big sides seemed at one\\'s very\\nelbow, and its majestic dome, and the lofty cluster of slender minarets\\nthat were its neighbors, seemed to be almost over one\\'s head. It was\\nnight in the streets, and the lamps were sparkling everywhere; the broad\\nbases and shoulders of the mountains were in a deep gloom, but their\\nsummits swam in a strange rich glow which was really daylight, and yet\\nhad a mellow something about it which was very different from the hard\\nwhite glare of the kind of daylight I was used to. Its radiance was\\nstrong and clear, but at the same time it was singularly soft, and\\nspiritual, and benignant. No, it was not our harsh, aggressive,\\nrealistic daylight; it seemed properer to an enchanted land--or to\\nheaven.\\n\\nI had seen moonlight and daylight together before, but I had not seen\\ndaylight and black night elbow to elbow before. At least I had not seen\\nthe daylight resting upon an object sufficiently close at hand, before,\\nto make the contrast startling and at war with nature.\\n\\nThe daylight passed away. Presently the moon rose up behind some of\\nthose sky-piercing fingers or pinnacles of bare rock of which I have\\nspoken--they were a little to the left of the crest of Mont Blanc,\\nand right over our heads--but she couldn\\'t manage to climb high enough\\ntoward heaven to get entirely above them. She would show the glittering\\narch of her upper third, occasionally, and scrape it along behind the\\ncomblike row; sometimes a pinnacle stood straight up, like a statuette\\nof ebony, against that glittering white shield, then seemed to glide out\\nof it by its own volition and power, and become a dim specter, while the\\nnext pinnacle glided into its place and blotted the spotless disk with\\nthe black exclamation-point of its presence. The top of one pinnacle\\ntook the shapely, clean-cut form of a rabbit\\'s head, in the inkiest\\nsilhouette, while it rested against the moon. The unillumined peaks and\\nminarets, hovering vague and phantom-like above us while the others\\nwere painfully white and strong with snow and moonlight, made a peculiar\\neffect.\\n\\nBut when the moon, having passed the line of pinnacles, was hidden\\nbehind the stupendous white swell of Mont Blanc, the masterpiece of the\\nevening was flung on the canvas. A rich greenish radiance sprang into\\nthe sky from behind the mountain, and in this some airy shreds and\\nribbons of vapor floated about, and being flushed with that strange\\ntint, went waving to and fro like pale green flames. After a while,\\nradiating bars--vast broadening fan-shaped shadows--grew up and\\nstretched away to the zenith from behind the mountain. It was a\\nspectacle to take one\\'s breath, for the wonder of it, and the sublimity.\\n\\nIndeed, those mighty bars of alternate light and shadow streaming up\\nfrom behind that dark and prodigious form and occupying the half of the\\ndull and opaque heavens, was the most imposing and impressive marvel I\\nhad ever looked upon. There is no simile for it, for nothing is like\\nit. If a child had asked me what it was, I should have said, \"Humble\\nyourself, in this presence, it is the glory flowing from the hidden head\\nof the Creator.\" One falls shorter of the truth than that, sometimes, in\\ntrying to explain mysteries to the little people. I could have found\\nout the cause of this awe-compelling miracle by inquiring, for it is not\\ninfrequent at Mont Blanc,--but I did not wish to know. We have not the\\nreverent feeling for the rainbow that a savage has, because we know how\\nit is made. We have lost as much as we gained by prying into the matter.\\n\\nWe took a walk down street, a block or two, and a place where four\\nstreets met and the principal shops were clustered, found the groups\\nof men in the roadway thicker than ever--for this was the Exchange of\\nChamonix. These men were in the costumes of guides and porters, and were\\nthere to be hired.\\n\\nThe office of that great personage, the Guide-in-Chief of the Chamonix\\nGuild of Guides, was near by. This guild is a close corporation, and is\\ngoverned by strict laws. There are many excursion routes, some dangerous\\nand some not, some that can be made safely without a guide, and some\\nthat cannot. The bureau determines these things. Where it decides that a\\nguide is necessary, you are forbidden to go without one. Neither are you\\nallowed to be a victim of extortion: the law states what you are to pay.\\nThe guides serve in rotation; you cannot select the man who is to take\\nyour life into his hands, you must take the worst in the lot, if it is\\nhis turn. A guide\\'s fee ranges all the way up from a half-dollar (for\\nsome trifling excursion of a few rods) to twenty dollars, according to\\nthe distance traversed and the nature of the ground. A guide\\'s fee\\nfor taking a person to the summit of Mont Blanc and back, is twenty\\ndollars--and he earns it. The time employed is usually three days, and\\nthere is enough early rising in it to make a man far more \"healthy and\\nwealthy and wise\" than any one man has any right to be. The porter\\'s\\nfee for the same trip is ten dollars. Several fools--no, I mean several\\ntourists--usually go together, and divide up the expense, and thus make\\nit light; for if only one f--tourist, I mean--went, he would have to\\nhave several guides and porters, and that would make the matter costly.\\n\\nWe went into the Chief\\'s office. There were maps of mountains on the\\nwalls; also one or two lithographs of celebrated guides, and a portrait\\nof the scientist De Saussure.\\n\\nIn glass cases were some labeled fragments of boots and batons, and\\nother suggestive relics and remembrances of casualties on Mount Blanc.\\nIn a book was a record of all the ascents which have ever been made,\\nbeginning with Nos. 1 and 2--being those of Jacques Balmat and De\\nSaussure, in 1787, and ending with No. 685, which wasn\\'t cold yet. In\\nfact No. 685 was standing by the official table waiting to receive the\\nprecious official diploma which should prove to his German household and\\nto his descendants that he had once been indiscreet enough to climb to\\nthe top of Mont Blanc. He looked very happy when he got his document; in\\nfact, he spoke up and said he _was_ happy.\\n\\nI tried to buy a diploma for an invalid friend at home who had never\\ntraveled, and whose desire all his life has been to ascend Mont Blanc,\\nbut the Guide-in-Chief rather insolently refused to sell me one. I was\\nvery much offended. I said I did not propose to be discriminated against\\non the account of my nationality; that he had just sold a diploma to\\nthis German gentleman, and my money was a good as his; I would see to\\nit that he couldn\\'t keep his shop for Germans and deny his produce to\\nAmericans; I would have his license taken away from him at the dropping\\nof a handkerchief; if France refused to break him, I would make an\\ninternational matter of it and bring on a war; the soil should be\\ndrenched with blood; and not only that, but I would set up an opposition\\nshow and sell diplomas at half price.\\n\\nFor two cents I would have done these things, too; but nobody offered me\\ntwo cents. I tried to move that German\\'s feelings, but it could not be\\ndone; he would not give me his diploma, neither would he sell it to me.\\nI _told_ him my friend was sick and could not come himself, but he\\nsaid he did not care a _verdammtes pfennig_, he wanted his diploma for\\nhimself--did I suppose he was going to risk his neck for that thing and\\nthen give it to a sick stranger? Indeed he wouldn\\'t, so he wouldn\\'t. I\\nresolved, then, that I would do all I could to injure Mont Blanc.\\n\\nIn the record-book was a list of all the fatal accidents which happened\\non the mountain. It began with the one in 1820 when the Russian Dr.\\nHamel\\'s three guides were lost in a crevice of the glacier, and it\\nrecorded the delivery of the remains in the valley by the slow-moving\\nglacier forty-one years later. The latest catastrophe bore the date\\n1877.\\n\\nWe stepped out and roved about the village awhile. In front of the\\nlittle church was a monument to the memory of the bold guide Jacques\\nBalmat, the first man who ever stood upon the summit of Mont Blanc. He\\nmade that wild trip solitary and alone. He accomplished the ascent\\na number of times afterward. A stretch of nearly half a century lay\\nbetween his first ascent and his last one. At the ripe old age of\\nseventy-two he was climbing around a corner of a lofty precipice of the\\nPic du Midi--nobody with him--when he slipped and fell. So he died in\\nthe harness.\\n\\nHe had grown very avaricious in his old age, and used to go off\\nstealthily to hunt for non-existent and impossible gold among those\\nperilous peaks and precipices. He was on a quest of that kind when he\\nlost his life. There was a statue to him, and another to De Saussure, in\\nthe hall of our hotel, and a metal plate on the door of a room upstairs\\nbore an inscription to the effect that that room had been occupied\\nby Albert Smith. Balmat and De Saussure discovered Mont Blanc--so to\\nspeak--but it was Smith who made it a paying property. His articles in\\n_Blackwood_ and his lectures on Mont Blanc in London advertised it and\\nmade people as anxious to see it as if it owed them money.\\n\\nAs we strolled along the road we looked up and saw a red signal-light\\nglowing in the darkness of the mountainside. It seemed but a trifling\\nway up--perhaps a hundred yards, a climb of ten minutes. It was a lucky\\npiece of sagacity in us that we concluded to stop a man whom we met and\\nget a light for our pipes from him instead of continuing the climb to\\nthat lantern to get a light, as had been our purpose. The man said that\\nthat lantern was on the Grands Mulets, some sixty-five hundred feet\\nabove the valley! I know by our Riffelberg experience, that it would\\nhave taken us a good part of a week to go up there. I would sooner not\\nsmoke at all, than take all that trouble for a light.\\n\\nEven in the daytime the foreshadowing effect of this mountain\\'s close\\nproximity creates curious deceptions. For instance, one sees with the\\nnaked eye a cabin up there beside the glacier, and a little above and\\nbeyond he sees the spot where that red light was located; he thinks he\\ncould throw a stone from the one place to the other. But he couldn\\'t,\\nfor the difference between the two altitudes is more than three thousand\\nfeet. It looks impossible, from below, that this can be true, but it is\\ntrue, nevertheless.\\n\\nWhile strolling around, we kept the run of the moon all the time, and we\\nstill kept an eye on her after we got back to the hotel portico. I had\\na theory that the gravitation of refraction, being subsidiary to\\natmospheric compensation, the refrangibility of the earth\\'s surface\\nwould emphasize this effect in regions where great mountain ranges\\noccur, and possibly so even-handed impact the odic and idyllic forces\\ntogether, the one upon the other, as to prevent the moon from rising\\nhigher than 12,200 feet above sea-level. This daring theory had been\\nreceived with frantic scorn by some of my fellow-scientists, and with\\nan eager silence by others. Among the former I may mention Prof. H----y;\\nand among the latter Prof. T----l. Such is professional jealousy; a\\nscientist will never show any kindness for a theory which he did not\\nstart himself. There is no feeling of brotherhood among these people.\\nIndeed, they always resent it when I call them brother. To show how far\\ntheir ungenerosity can carry them, I will state that I offered to let\\nProf. H----y publish my great theory as his own discovery; I even begged\\nhim to do it; I even proposed to print it myself as his theory. Instead\\nof thanking me, he said that if I tried to fasten that theory on him he\\nwould sue me for slander. I was going to offer it to Mr. Darwin, whom\\nI understood to be a man without prejudices, but it occurred to me\\nthat perhaps he would not be interested in it since it did not concern\\nheraldry.\\n\\nBut I am glad now, that I was forced to father my intrepid theory\\nmyself, for, on the night of which I am writing, it was triumphantly\\njustified and established. Mont Blanc is nearly sixteen thousand feet\\nhigh; he hid the moon utterly; near him is a peak which is 12,216 feet\\nhigh; the moon slid along behind the pinnacles, and when she approached\\nthat one I watched her with intense interest, for my reputation as a\\nscientist must stand or fall by its decision. I cannot describe the\\nemotions which surged like tidal waves through my breast when I saw the\\nmoon glide behind that lofty needle and pass it by without exposing more\\nthan two feet four inches of her upper rim above it; I was secure, then.\\nI knew she could rise no higher, and I was right. She sailed behind all\\nthe peaks and never succeeded in hoisting her disk above a single one of\\nthem.\\n\\nWhile the moon was behind one of those sharp fingers, its shadow was\\nflung athwart the vacant heavens--a long, slanting, clean-cut, dark\\nray--with a streaming and energetic suggestion of _force_ about it, such\\nas the ascending jet of water from a powerful fire-engine affords. It\\nwas curious to see a good strong shadow of an earthly object cast upon\\nso intangible a field as the atmosphere.\\n\\nWe went to bed, at last, and went quickly to sleep, but I woke up,\\nafter about three hours, with throbbing temples, and a head which was\\nphysically sore, outside and in. I was dazed, dreamy, wretched, seedy,\\nunrefreshed. I recognized the occasion of all this: it was that torrent.\\nIn the mountain villages of Switzerland, and along the roads, one has\\nalways the roar of the torrent in his ears. He imagines it is music, and\\nhe thinks poetic things about it; he lies in his comfortable bed and is\\nlulled to sleep by it. But by and by he begins to notice that his\\nhead is very sore--he cannot account for it; in solitudes where the\\nprofoundest silence reigns, he notices a sullen, distant, continuous\\nroar in his ears, which is like what he would experience if he had\\nsea-shells pressed against them--he cannot account for it; he is drowsy\\nand absent-minded; there is no tenacity to his mind, he cannot keep hold\\nof a thought and follow it out; if he sits down to write, his vocabulary\\nis empty, no suitable words will come, he forgets what he started to do,\\nand remains there, pen in hand, head tilted up, eyes closed, listening\\npainfully to the muffled roar of a distant train in his ears; in his\\nsoundest sleep the strain continues, he goes on listening, always\\nlistening intently, anxiously, and wakes at last, harassed, irritable,\\nunrefreshed. He cannot manage to account for these things.\\n\\nDay after day he feels as if he had spent his nights in a sleeping-car.\\nIt actually takes him weeks to find out that it is those persecuting\\ntorrents that have been making all the mischief. It is time for him\\nto get out of Switzerland, then, for as soon as he has discovered the\\ncause, the misery is magnified several fold. The roar of the torrent is\\nmaddening, then, for his imagination is assisting; the physical pain\\nit inflicts is exquisite. When he finds he is approaching one of those\\nstreams, his dread is so lively that he is disposed to fly the track and\\navoid the implacable foe.\\n\\nEight or nine months after the distress of the torrents had departed\\nfrom me, the roar and thunder of the streets of Paris brought it all\\nback again. I moved to the sixth story of the hotel to hunt for peace.\\nAbout midnight the noises dulled away, and I was sinking to sleep,\\nwhen I heard a new and curious sound; I listened: evidently some joyous\\nlunatic was softly dancing a \"double shuffle\" in the room over my head.\\nI had to wait for him to get through, of course. Five long, long minutes\\nhe smoothly shuffled away--a pause followed, then something fell with\\na thump on the floor. I said to myself \"There--he is pulling off his\\nboots--thank heavens he is done.\" Another slight pause--he went to\\nshuffling again! I said to myself, \"Is he trying to see what he can do\\nwith only one boot on?\" Presently came another pause and another thump\\non the floor. I said \"Good, he has pulled off his other boot--_now_ he\\nis done.\" But he wasn\\'t. The next moment he was shuffling again. I said,\\n\"Confound him, he is at it in his slippers!\" After a little came that\\nsame old pause, and right after it that thump on the floor once more.\\nI said, \"Hang him, he had on _two_ pair of boots!\" For an hour that\\nmagician went on shuffling and pulling off boots till he had shed as\\nmany as twenty-five pair, and I was hovering on the verge of lunacy. I\\ngot my gun and stole up there. The fellow was in the midst of an acre of\\nsprawling boots, and he had a boot in his hand, shuffling it--no, I mean\\n_polishing_ it. The mystery was explained. He hadn\\'t been dancing. He\\nwas the \"Boots\" of the hotel, and was attending to business.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIX\\n\\n[I Scale Mont Blanc--by Telescope]\\n\\nAfter breakfast, that next morning in Chamonix, we went out in the yard\\nand watched the gangs of excursioning tourists arriving and departing\\nwith their mules and guides and porters; then we took a look through\\nthe telescope at the snowy hump of Mont Blanc. It was brilliant with\\nsunshine, and the vast smooth bulge seemed hardly five hundred yards\\naway. With the naked eye we could dimly make out the house at the Pierre\\nPointue, which is located by the side of the great glacier, and is more\\nthan three thousand feet above the level of the valley; but with the\\ntelescope we could see all its details. While I looked, a woman rode by\\nthe house on a mule, and I saw her with sharp distinctness; I could have\\ndescribed her dress. I saw her nod to the people of the house, and rein\\nup her mule, and put her hand up to shield her eyes from the sun. I was\\nnot used to telescopes; in fact, I had never looked through a good one\\nbefore; it seemed incredible to me that this woman could be so far away.\\nI was satisfied that I could see all these details with my naked\\neye; but when I tried it, that mule and those vivid people had wholly\\nvanished, and the house itself was become small and vague. I tried\\nthe telescope again, and again everything was vivid. The strong black\\nshadows of the mule and the woman were flung against the side of the\\nhouse, and I saw the mule\\'s silhouette wave its ears.\\n\\nThe telescopulist--or the telescopulariat--I do not know which is\\nright--said a party were making a grand ascent, and would come in sight\\non the remote upper heights, presently; so we waited to observe this\\nperformance. Presently I had a superb idea. I wanted to stand with a\\nparty on the summit of Mont Blanc, merely to be able to say I had done\\nit, and I believed the telescope could set me within seven feet of the\\nuppermost man. The telescoper assured me that it could. I then asked him\\nhow much I owed him for as far as I had got? He said, one franc. I asked\\nhim how much it would cost to make the entire ascent? Three francs. I at\\nonce determined to make the entire ascent. But first I inquired if there\\nwas any danger? He said no--not by telescope; said he had taken a great\\nmany parties to the summit, and never lost a man. I asked what he would\\ncharge to let my agent go with me, together with such guides and porters\\nas might be necessary. He said he would let Harris go for two francs;\\nand that unless we were unusually timid, he should consider guides and\\nporters unnecessary; it was not customary to take them, when going by\\ntelescope, for they were rather an encumbrance than a help. He said that\\nthe party now on the mountain were approaching the most difficult part,\\nand if we hurried we should overtake them within ten minutes, and could\\nthen join them and have the benefit of their guides and porters without\\ntheir knowledge, and without expense to us.\\n\\nI then said we would start immediately. I believe I said it calmly,\\nthough I was conscious of a shudder and of a paling cheek, in view of\\nthe nature of the exploit I was so unreflectingly engaged in. But the\\nold daredevil spirit was upon me, and I said that as I had committed\\nmyself I would not back down; I would ascend Mont Blanc if it cost me\\nmy life. I told the man to slant his machine in the proper direction and\\nlet us be off.\\n\\nHarris was afraid and did not want to go, but I heartened him up and\\nsaid I would hold his hand all the way; so he gave his consent, though\\nhe trembled a little at first. I took a last pathetic look upon the\\npleasant summer scene about me, then boldly put my eye to the glass and\\nprepared to mount among the grim glaciers and the everlasting snows.\\n\\nWe took our way carefully and cautiously across the great Glacier des\\nBossons, over yawning and terrific crevices and among imposing crags\\nand buttresses of ice which were fringed with icicles of gigantic\\nproportions. The desert of ice that stretched far and wide about us was\\nwild and desolate beyond description, and the perils which beset us were\\nso great that at times I was minded to turn back. But I pulled my pluck\\ntogether and pushed on.\\n\\nWe passed the glacier safely and began to mount the steeps beyond, with\\ngreat alacrity. When we were seven minutes out from the starting-point,\\nwe reached an altitude where the scene took a new aspect; an apparently\\nlimitless continent of gleaming snow was tilted heavenward before our\\nfaces. As my eye followed that awful acclivity far away up into the\\nremote skies, it seemed to me that all I had ever seen before of\\nsublimity and magnitude was small and insignificant compared to this.\\n\\nWe rested a moment, and then began to mount with speed. Within three\\nminutes we caught sight of the party ahead of us, and stopped to observe\\nthem. They were toiling up a long, slanting ridge of snow--twelve\\npersons, roped together some fifteen feet apart, marching in single\\nfile, and strongly marked against the clear blue sky. One was a woman.\\nWe could see them lift their feet and put them down; we saw them swing\\ntheir alpenstocks forward in unison, like so many pendulums, and then\\nbear their weight upon them; we saw the lady wave her handkerchief. They\\ndragged themselves upward in a worn and weary way, for they had been\\nclimbing steadily from the Grand Mulets, on the Glacier des Bossons,\\nsince three in the morning, and it was eleven, now. We saw them sink\\ndown in the snow and rest, and drink something from a bottle. After a\\nwhile they moved on, and as they approached the final short dash of the\\nhome-stretch we closed up on them and joined them.\\n\\nPresently we all stood together on the summit! What a view was spread\\nout below! Away off under the northwestern horizon rolled the silent\\nbillows of the Farnese Oberland, their snowy crests glinting softly in\\nthe subdued lights of distance; in the north rose the giant form of the\\nWobblehorn, draped from peak to shoulder in sable thunder-clouds; beyond\\nhim, to the right, stretched the grand processional summits of the\\nCisalpine Cordillera, drowned in a sensuous haze; to the east loomed the\\ncolossal masses of the Yodelhorn, the Fuddelhorn, and the Dinnerhorn,\\ntheir cloudless summits flashing white and cold in the sun; beyond\\nthem shimmered the faint far line of the Ghauts of Jubbelpore and the\\nAiguilles des Alleghenies; in the south towered the smoking peak\\nof Popocatapetl and the unapproachable altitudes of the peerless\\nScrabblehorn; in the west-south the stately range of the Himalayas lay\\ndreaming in a purple gloom; and thence all around the curving horizon\\nthe eye roved over a troubled sea of sun-kissed Alps, and noted,\\nhere and there, the noble proportions and the soaring domes of the\\nBottlehorn, and the Saddlehorn, and the Shovelhorn, and the Powderhorn,\\nall bathed in the glory of noon and mottled with softly gliding blots,\\nthe shadows flung from drifting clouds.\\n\\nOvercome by the scene, we all raised a triumphant, tremendous shout, in\\nunison. A startled man at my elbow said:\\n\\n\"Confound you, what do you yell like that for, right here in the\\nstreet?\"\\n\\nThat brought me down to Chamonix, like a flirt. I gave that man some\\nspiritual advice and disposed of him, and then paid the telescope man\\nhis full fee, and said that we were charmed with the trip and would\\nremain down, and not reascend and require him to fetch us down by\\ntelescope. This pleased him very much, for of course we could have\\nstepped back to the summit and put him to the trouble of bringing us\\nhome if we wanted to.\\n\\nI judged we could get diplomas, now, anyhow; so we went after them, but\\nthe Chief Guide put us off, with one pretext or another, during all the\\ntime we stayed in Chamonix, and we ended by never getting them at all.\\nSo much for his prejudice against people\\'s nationality. However, we\\nworried him enough to make him remember us and our ascent for some\\ntime. He even said, once, that he wished there was a lunatic asylum\\nin Chamonix. This shows that he really had fears that we were going to\\ndrive him mad. It was what we intended to do, but lack of time defeated\\nit.\\n\\nI cannot venture to advise the reader one way or the other, as to\\nascending Mont Blanc. I say only this: if he is at all timid, the\\nenjoyments of the trip will hardly make up for the hardships and\\nsufferings he will have to endure. But, if he has good nerve, youth,\\nhealth, and a bold, firm will, and could leave his family comfortably\\nprovided for in case the worst happened, he would find the ascent a\\nwonderful experience, and the view from the top a vision to dream about,\\nand tell about, and recall with exultation all the days of his life.\\n\\nWhile I do not advise such a person to attempt the ascent, I do not\\nadvise him against it. But if he elects to attempt it, let him be warily\\ncareful of two things: chose a calm, clear day; and do not pay the\\ntelescope man in advance. There are dark stories of his getting advance\\npayers on the summit and then leaving them there to rot.\\n\\nA frightful tragedy was once witnessed through the Chamonix telescopes.\\nThink of questions and answers like these, on an inquest:\\n\\nCORONER. You saw deceased lose his life?\\n\\nWITNESS. I did.\\n\\nC. Where was he, at the time?\\n\\nW. Close to the summit of Mont Blanc.\\n\\nC. Where were you?\\n\\nW. In the main street of Chamonix.\\n\\nC. What was the distance between you?\\n\\nW. _A little over five miles_, as the bird flies.\\n\\nThis accident occurred in 1866, a year and a month after the disaster\\non the Matterhorn. Three adventurous English gentlemen, [1] of great\\nexperience in mountain-climbing, made up their minds to ascend Mont\\nBlanc without guides or porters. All endeavors to dissuade them from\\ntheir project failed. Powerful telescopes are numerous in Chamonix.\\nThese huge brass tubes, mounted on their scaffoldings and pointed\\nskyward from every choice vantage-ground, have the formidable look of\\nartillery, and give the town the general aspect of getting ready\\nto repel a charge of angels. The reader may easily believe that the\\ntelescopes had plenty of custom on that August morning in 1866, for\\neverybody knew of the dangerous undertaking which was on foot, and\\nall had fears that misfortune would result. All the morning the tubes\\nremained directed toward the mountain heights, each with its anxious\\ngroup around it; but the white deserts were vacant.\\n\\n1. Sir George Young and his brothers James and Albert.\\n\\nAt last, toward eleven o\\'clock, the people who were looking through the\\ntelescopes cried out \"There they are!\"--and sure enough, far up, on\\nthe loftiest terraces of the Grand Plateau, the three pygmies appeared,\\nclimbing with remarkable vigor and spirit. They disappeared in the\\n\"Corridor,\" and were lost to sight during an hour. Then they reappeared,\\nand were presently seen standing together upon the extreme summit\\nof Mont Blanc. So, all was well. They remained a few minutes on that\\nhighest point of land in Europe, a target for all the telescopes, and\\nwere then seen to begin descent. Suddenly all three vanished. An instant\\nafter, they appeared again, _two thousand feet below_!\\n\\nEvidently, they had tripped and been shot down an almost perpendicular\\nslope of ice to a point where it joined the border of the upper glacier.\\nNaturally, the distant witness supposed they were now looking upon three\\ncorpses; so they could hardly believe their eyes when they presently saw\\ntwo of the men rise to their feet and bend over the third. During\\ntwo hours and a half they watched the two busying themselves over the\\nextended form of their brother, who seemed entirely inert. Chamonix\\'s\\naffairs stood still; everybody was in the street, all interest was\\ncentered upon what was going on upon that lofty and isolated stage\\nfive miles away. Finally the two--one of them walking with great\\ndifficulty--were seen to begin descent, abandoning the third, who was no\\ndoubt lifeless. Their movements were followed, step by step, until they\\nreached the \"Corridor\" and disappeared behind its ridge. Before they had\\nhad time to traverse the \"Corridor\" and reappear, twilight was come, and\\nthe power of the telescope was at an end.\\n\\nThe survivors had a most perilous journey before them in the gathering\\ndarkness, for they must get down to the Grands Mulets before they would\\nfind a safe stopping-place--a long and tedious descent, and perilous\\nenough even in good daylight. The oldest guides expressed the opinion\\nthat they could not succeed; that all the chances were that they would\\nlose their lives.\\n\\nYet those brave men did succeed. They reached the Grands Mulets in\\nsafety. Even the fearful shock which their nerves had sustained was not\\nsufficient to overcome their coolness and courage. It would appear from\\nthe official account that they were threading their way down through\\nthose dangers from the closing in of twilight until two o\\'clock in the\\nmorning, or later, because the rescuing party from Chamonix reached\\nthe Grand Mulets about three in the morning and moved thence toward the\\nscene of the disaster under the leadership of Sir George Young, \"who had\\nonly just arrived.\"\\n\\nAfter having been on his feet twenty-four hours, in the exhausting work\\nof mountain-climbing, Sir George began the reascent at the head of the\\nrelief party of six guides, to recover the corpse of his brother. This\\nwas considered a new imprudence, as the number was too few for the\\nservice required. Another relief party presently arrived at the cabin\\non the Grands Mulets and quartered themselves there to await events. Ten\\nhours after Sir George\\'s departure toward the summit, this new relief\\nwere still scanning the snowy altitudes above them from their own high\\nperch among the ice deserts ten thousand feet above the level of the\\nsea, but the whole forenoon had passed without a glimpse of any living\\nthing appearing up there.\\n\\nThis was alarming. Half a dozen of their number set out, then early in\\nthe afternoon, to seek and succor Sir George and his guides. The persons\\nremaining at the cabin saw these disappear, and then ensued another\\ndistressing wait. Four hours passed, without tidings. Then at five\\no\\'clock another relief, consisting of three guides, set forward from\\nthe cabin. They carried food and cordials for the refreshment of their\\npredecessors; they took lanterns with them, too; night was coming on,\\nand to make matters worse, a fine, cold rain had begun to fall.\\n\\nAt the same hour that these three began their dangerous ascent, the\\nofficial Guide-in-Chief of the Mont Blanc region undertook the dangerous\\ndescent to Chamonix, all alone, to get reinforcements. However, a couple\\nof hours later, at 7 P.M., the anxious solicitude came to an end, and\\nhappily. A bugle note was heard, and a cluster of black specks was\\ndistinguishable against the snows of the upper heights. The watchers\\ncounted these specks eagerly--fourteen--nobody was missing. An hour and\\na half later they were all safe under the roof of the cabin. They had\\nbrought the corpse with them. Sir George Young tarried there but a few\\nminutes, and then began the long and troublesome descent from the cabin\\nto Chamonix. He probably reached there about two or three o\\'clock in the\\nmorning, after having been afoot among the rocks and glaciers during two\\ndays and two nights. His endurance was equal to his daring.\\n\\nThe cause of the unaccountable delay of Sir George and the relief\\nparties among the heights where the disaster had happened was a thick\\nfog--or, partly that and partly the slow and difficult work of conveying\\nthe dead body down the perilous steeps.\\n\\nThe corpse, upon being viewed at the inquest, showed no bruises, and it\\nwas some time before the surgeons discovered that the neck was broken.\\nOne of the surviving brothers had sustained some unimportant injuries,\\nbut the other had suffered no hurt at all. How these men could fall two\\nthousand feet, almost perpendicularly, and live afterward, is a most\\nstrange and unaccountable thing.\\n\\nA great many women have made the ascent of Mont Blanc. An English girl,\\nMiss Stratton, conceived the daring idea, two or three years ago, of\\nattempting the ascent in the middle of winter. She tried it--and she\\nsucceeded. Moreover, she froze two of her fingers on the way up, she\\nfell in love with her guide on the summit, and she married him when she\\ngot to the bottom again. There is nothing in romance, in the way of a\\nstriking \"situation,\" which can beat this love scene in midheaven on\\nan isolated ice-crest with the thermometer at zero and an Artic gale\\nblowing.\\n\\nThe first woman who ascended Mont Blanc was a girl aged\\ntwenty-two--Mlle. Maria Paradis--1809. Nobody was with her but her\\nsweetheart, and he was not a guide. The sex then took a rest for about\\nthirty years, when a Mlle. d\\'Angeville made the ascent--1838. In\\nChamonix I picked up a rude old lithograph of that day which pictured\\nher \"in the act.\"\\n\\nHowever, I value it less as a work of art than as a fashion-plate. Miss\\nd\\'Angeville put on a pair of men\\'s pantaloons to climb it, which was\\nwise; but she cramped their utility by adding her petticoat, which was\\nidiotic.\\n\\nOne of the mournfulest calamities which men\\'s disposition to climb\\ndangerous mountains has resulted in, happened on Mont Blanc in September\\n1870. M. D\\'Arve tells the story briefly in his _Histoire Du Mont Blanc_.\\nIn the next chapter I will copy its chief features.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLV\\n\\nA Catastrophe Which Cost Eleven Lives\\n\\nOn the 5th of September, 1870, a caravan of eleven persons departed\\nfrom Chamonix to make the ascent of Mont Blanc. Three of the party\\nwere tourists; Messrs. Randall and Bean, Americans, and Mr. George\\nCorkindale, a Scotch gentleman; there were three guides and five\\nporters. The cabin on the Grands Mulets was reached that day; the ascent\\nwas resumed early the next morning, September 6th. The day was fine\\nand clear, and the movements of the party were observed through the\\ntelescopes of Chamonix; at two o\\'clock in the afternoon they were seen\\nto reach the summit. A few minutes later they were seen making the first\\nsteps of the descent; then a cloud closed around them and hid them from\\nview.\\n\\nEight hours passed, the cloud still remained, night came, no one had\\nreturned to the Grands Mulets. Sylvain Couttet, keeper of the cabin\\nthere, suspected a misfortune, and sent down to the valley for help. A\\ndetachment of guides went up, but by the time they had made the tedious\\ntrip and reached the cabin, a raging storm had set in. They had to wait;\\nnothing could be attempted in such a tempest.\\n\\nThe wild storm lasted _more than a week_, without ceasing; but on the\\n17th, Couttet, with several guides, left the cabin and succeeded in\\nmaking the ascent. In the snowy wastes near the summit they came upon\\nfive bodies, lying upon their sides in a reposeful attitude which\\nsuggested that possibly they had fallen asleep there, while exhausted\\nwith fatigue and hunger and benumbed with cold, and never knew when\\ndeath stole upon them. Couttet moved a few steps further and discovered\\nfive more bodies. The eleventh corpse--that of a porter--was not found,\\nalthough diligent search was made for it.\\n\\nIn the pocket of Mr. Bean, one of the Americans, was found a note-book\\nin which had been penciled some sentences which admit us, in flesh and\\nspirit, as it were, to the presence of these men during their last hours\\nof life, and to the grisly horrors which their fading vision looked upon\\nand their failing consciousness took cognizance of:\\n\\nTUESDAY, SEPT. 6. I have made the ascent of Mont Blanc, with ten\\npersons--eight guides, and Mr. Corkindale and Mr. Randall. We reached\\nthe summit at half past 2. Immediately after quitting it, we were\\nenveloped in clouds of snow. We passed the night in a grotto hollowed in\\nthe snow, which afforded us but poor shelter, and I was ill all night.\\n\\nSEPT. 7--MORNING. The cold is excessive. The snow falls heavily and\\nwithout interruption. The guides take no rest.\\n\\nEVENING. My Dear Hessie, we have been two days on Mont Blanc, in the\\nmidst of a terrible hurricane of snow, we have lost our way, and are\\nin a hole scooped in the snow, at an altitude of 15,000 feet. I have no\\nlonger any hope of descending.\\n\\nThey had wandered around, and around, in the blinding snow-storm,\\nhopelessly lost, in a space only a hundred yards square; and when cold\\nand fatigue vanquished them at last, they scooped their cave and lay\\ndown there to die by inches, _unaware that five steps more would have\\nbrought them into the true path._ They were so near to life and safety\\nas that, and did not suspect it. The thought of this gives the sharpest\\npang that the tragic story conveys.\\n\\nThe author of the _Histoire Du Mont Blanc_ introduced the closing\\nsentences of Mr. Bean\\'s pathetic record thus:\\n\\n\"Here the characters are large and unsteady; the hand which traces them\\nis become chilled and torpid; but the spirit survives, and the faith and\\nresignation of the dying man are expressed with a sublime simplicity.\"\\n\\nPerhaps this note-book will be found and sent to you. We have nothing to\\neat, my feet are already frozen, and I am exhausted; I have strength to\\nwrite only a few words more. I have left means for C\\'s education; I know\\nyou will employ them wisely. I die with faith in God, and with loving\\nthoughts of you. Farewell to all. We shall meet again, in Heaven. ... I\\nthink of you always.\\n\\nIt is the way of the Alps to deliver death to their victims with a\\nmerciful swiftness, but here the rule failed. These men suffered\\nthe bitterest death that has been recorded in the history of those\\nmountains, freighted as that history is with grisly tragedies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVI\\n\\n[Meeting a Hog on a Precipice]\\n\\nMr. Harris and I took some guides and porters and ascended to the Hotel\\ndes Pyramides, which is perched on the high moraine which borders the\\nGlacier des Bossons. The road led sharply uphill, all the way, through\\ngrass and flowers and woods, and was a pleasant walk, barring the\\nfatigue of the climb.\\n\\nFrom the hotel we could view the huge glacier at very close range. After\\na rest we followed down a path which had been made in the steep inner\\nfrontage of the moraine, and stepped upon the glacier itself. One of the\\nshows of the place was a tunnel-like cavern, which had been hewn in the\\nglacier. The proprietor of this tunnel took candles and conducted us\\ninto it. It was three or four feet wide and about six feet high. Its\\nwalls of pure and solid ice emitted a soft and rich blue light that\\nproduced a lovely effect, and suggested enchanted caves, and that sort\\nof thing. When we had proceeded some yards and were entering darkness,\\nwe turned about and had a dainty sunlit picture of distant woods and\\nheights framed in the strong arch of the tunnel and seen through the\\ntender blue radiance of the tunnel\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\nThe cavern was nearly a hundred yards long, and when we reached its\\ninner limit the proprietor stepped into a branch tunnel with his candles\\nand left us buried in the bowels of the glacier, and in pitch-darkness.\\nWe judged his purpose was murder and robbery; so we got out our matches\\nand prepared to sell our lives as dearly as possible by setting the\\nglacier on fire if the worst came to the worst--but we soon perceived\\nthat this man had changed his mind; he began to sing, in a deep,\\nmelodious voice, and woke some curious and pleasing echoes. By and by he\\ncame back and pretended that that was what he had gone behind there for.\\nWe believed as much of that as we wanted to.\\n\\nThus our lives had been once more in imminent peril, but by the exercise\\nof the swift sagacity and cool courage which had saved us so often, we\\nhad added another escape to the long list. The tourist should visit that\\nice-cavern, by all means, for it is well worth the trouble; but I would\\nadvise him to go only with a strong and well-armed force. I do not\\nconsider artillery necessary, yet it would not be unadvisable to take\\nit along, if convenient. The journey, going and coming, is about three\\nmiles and a half, three of which are on level ground. We made it in\\nless than a day, but I would counsel the unpracticed--if not pressed\\nfor time--to allow themselves two. Nothing is gained in the Alps by\\nover-exertion; nothing is gained by crowding two days\\' work into one for\\nthe poor sake of being able to boast of the exploit afterward. It will\\nbe found much better, in the long run, to do the thing in two days, and\\nthen subtract one of them from the narrative. This saves fatigue, and\\ndoes not injure the narrative. All the more thoughtful among the Alpine\\ntourists do this.\\n\\nWe now called upon the Guide-in-Chief, and asked for a squadron of\\nguides and porters for the ascent of the Montanvert. This idiot glared\\nat us, and said:\\n\\n\"You don\\'t need guides and porters to go to the Montanvert.\"\\n\\n\"What do we need, then?\"\\n\\n\"Such as _you_?--an ambulance!\"\\n\\nI was so stung by this brutal remark that I took my custom elsewhere.\\n\\nBetimes, next morning, we had reached an altitude of five thousand feet\\nabove the level of the sea. Here we camped and breakfasted. There was\\na cabin there--the spot is called the Caillet--and a spring of ice-cold\\nwater. On the door of the cabin was a sign, in French, to the effect\\nthat \"One may here see a living chamois for fifty centimes.\" We did not\\ninvest; what we wanted was to see a dead one.\\n\\nA little after noon we ended the ascent and arrived at the new hotel on\\nthe Montanvert, and had a view of six miles, right up the great glacier,\\nthe famous Mer de Glace. At this point it is like a sea whose deep\\nswales and long, rolling swells have been caught in mid-movement and\\nfrozen solid; but further up it is broken up into wildly tossing billows\\nof ice.\\n\\nWe descended a ticklish path in the steep side of the moraine, and\\ninvaded the glacier. There were tourists of both sexes scattered far and\\nwide over it, everywhere, and it had the festive look of a skating-rink.\\n\\nThe Empress Josephine came this far, once. She ascended the Montanvert\\nin 1810--but not alone; a small army of men preceded her to clear the\\npath--and carpet it, perhaps--and she followed, under the protection of\\n_sixty-eight_ guides.\\n\\nHer successor visited Chamonix later, but in far different style.\\n\\nIt was seven weeks after the first fall of the Empire, and poor Marie\\nLouise, ex-Empress was a fugitive. She came at night, and in a storm,\\nwith only two attendants, and stood before a peasant\\'s hut, tired,\\nbedraggled, soaked with rain, \"the red print of her lost crown still\\ngirdling her brow,\" and implored admittance--and was refused! A few days\\nbefore, the adulations and applauses of a nation were sounding in her\\nears, and now she was come to this!\\n\\nWe crossed the Mer de Glace in safety, but we had misgivings. The\\ncrevices in the ice yawned deep and blue and mysterious, and it made one\\nnervous to traverse them. The huge round waves of ice were slippery and\\ndifficult to climb, and the chances of tripping and sliding down them\\nand darting into a crevice were too many to be comfortable.\\n\\nIn the bottom of a deep swale between two of the biggest of the\\nice-waves, we found a fraud who pretended to be cutting steps to insure\\nthe safety of tourists. He was \"soldiering\" when we came upon him, but\\nhe hopped up and chipped out a couple of steps about big enough for a\\ncat, and charged us a franc or two for it. Then he sat down again, to\\ndoze till the next party should come along.\\n\\nHe had collected blackmail from two or three hundred people already,\\nthat day, but had not chipped out ice enough to impair the glacier\\nperceptibly. I have heard of a good many soft sinecures, but it seems\\nto me that keeping toll-bridge on a glacier is the softest one I have\\nencountered yet.\\n\\nThat was a blazing hot day, and it brought a persistent and persecuting\\nthirst with it. What an unspeakable luxury it was to slake that thirst\\nwith the pure and limpid ice-water of the glacier! Down the sides of\\nevery great rib of pure ice poured limpid rills in gutters carved by\\ntheir own attrition; better still, wherever a rock had lain, there was\\nnow a bowl-shaped hole, with smooth white sides and bottom of ice, and\\nthis bowl was brimming with water of such absolute clearness that the\\ncareless observer would not see it at all, but would think the bowl was\\nempty. These fountains had such an alluring look that I often stretched\\nmyself out when I was not thirsty and dipped my face in and drank till\\nmy teeth ached. Everywhere among the Swiss mountains we had at hand the\\nblessing--not to be found in Europe _except_ in the mountains--of water\\ncapable of quenching thirst. Everywhere in the Swiss highlands brilliant\\nlittle rills of exquisitely cold water went dancing along by the\\nroadsides, and my comrade and I were always drinking and always\\ndelivering our deep gratitude.\\n\\nBut in Europe everywhere except in the mountains, the water is flat and\\ninsipid beyond the power of words to describe. It is served lukewarm;\\nbut no matter, ice could not help it; it is incurably flat, incurably\\ninsipid. It is only good to wash with; I wonder it doesn\\'t occur to\\nthe average inhabitant to try it for that. In Europe the people say\\ncontemptuously, \"Nobody drinks water here.\" Indeed, they have a sound\\nand sufficient reason. In many places they even have what may be called\\nprohibitory reasons. In Paris and Munich, for instance, they say, \"Don\\'t\\ndrink the water, it is simply poison.\"\\n\\nEither America is healthier than Europe, notwithstanding her \"deadly\"\\nindulgence in ice-water, or she does not keep the run of her death-rate\\nas sharply as Europe does. I think we do keep up the death statistics\\naccurately; and if we do, our cities are healthier than the cities of\\nEurope. Every month the German government tabulates the death-rate of\\nthe world and publishes it. I scrap-booked these reports during several\\nmonths, and it was curious to see how regular and persistently each city\\nrepeated its same death-rate month after month. The tables might as well\\nhave been stereotyped, they varied so little. These tables were\\nbased upon weekly reports showing the average of deaths in each 1,000\\npopulation for a year. Munich was always present with her 33 deaths in\\neach 1,000 of her population (yearly average), Chicago was as constant\\nwith her 15 or 17, Dublin with her 48--and so on.\\n\\nOnly a few American cities appear in these tables, but they are\\nscattered so widely over the country that they furnish a good general\\naverage of _city_ health in the United States; and I think it will be\\ngranted that our towns and villages are healthier than our cities.\\n\\nHere is the average of the only American cities reported in the German\\ntables:\\n\\nChicago, deaths in 1,000 population annually, 16; Philadelphia, 18; St.\\nLouis, 18; San Francisco, 19; New York (the Dublin of America), 23.\\n\\nSee how the figures jump up, as soon as one arrives at the transatlantic\\nlist:\\n\\nParis, 27; Glasgow, 27; London, 28; Vienna, 28; Augsburg, 28;\\nBraunschweig, 28; Knigsberg, 29; Cologne, 29; Dresden, 29; Hamburg, 29;\\nBerlin, 30; Bombay, 30; Warsaw, 31; Breslau, 31; Odessa, 32; Munich, 33;\\nStrasburg, 33, Pesth, 35; Cassel, 35; Lisbon, 36; Liverpool, 36;\\nPrague, 37; Madras, 37; Bucharest, 39; St. Petersburg, 40; Trieste, 40;\\nAlexandria (Egypt), 43; Dublin, 48; Calcutta, 55.\\n\\nEdinburgh is as healthy as New York--23; but there is no _city_ in the\\nentire list which is healthier, except Frankfort-on-the-Main--20. But\\nFrankfort is not as healthy as Chicago, San Francisco, St. Louis, or\\nPhiladelphia.\\n\\nPerhaps a strict average of the world might develop the fact that where\\none in 1,000 of America\\'s population dies, two in 1,000 of the other\\npopulations of the earth succumb.\\n\\nI do not like to make insinuations, but I do think the above statistics\\ndarkly suggest that these people over here drink this detestable water\\n\"on the sly.\"\\n\\nWe climbed the moraine on the opposite side of the glacier, and then\\ncrept along its sharp ridge a hundred yards or so, in pretty constant\\ndanger of a tumble to the glacier below. The fall would have been only\\none hundred feet, but it would have closed me out as effectually as one\\nthousand, therefore I respected the distance accordingly, and was\\nglad when the trip was done. A moraine is an ugly thing to assault\\nhead-first. At a distance it looks like an endless grave of fine sand,\\naccurately shaped and nicely smoothed; but close by, it is found to be\\nmade mainly of rough boulders of all sizes, from that of a man\\'s head to\\nthat of a cottage.\\n\\nBy and by we came to the Mauvais Pas, or the Villainous Road, to\\ntranslate it feelingly. It was a breakneck path around the face of a\\nprecipice forty or fifty feet high, and nothing to hang on to but some\\niron railings. I got along, slowly, safely, and uncomfortably, and\\nfinally reached the middle. My hopes began to rise a little, but they\\nwere quickly blighted; for there I met a hog--a long-nosed, bristly\\nfellow, that held up his snout and worked his nostrils at me\\ninquiringly. A hog on a pleasure excursion in Switzerland--think of it!\\nIt is striking and unusual; a body might write a poem about it. He\\ncould not retreat, if he had been disposed to do it. It would have been\\nfoolish to stand upon our dignity in a place where there was hardly room\\nto stand upon our feet, so we did nothing of the sort. There were twenty\\nor thirty ladies and gentlemen behind us; we all turned about and went\\nback, and the hog followed behind. The creature did not seem set up by\\nwhat he had done; he had probably done it before.\\n\\nWe reached the restaurant on the height called the Chapeau at four in\\nthe afternoon. It was a memento-factory, and the stock was large, cheap,\\nand varied. I bought the usual paper-cutter to remember the place by,\\nand had Mont Blanc, the Mauvais Pas, and the rest of the region branded\\non my alpenstock; then we descended to the valley and walked home\\nwithout being tied together. This was not dangerous, for the valley was\\nfive miles wide, and quite level.\\n\\nWe reached the hotel before nine o\\'clock. Next morning we left for\\nGeneva on top of the diligence, under shelter of a gay awning. If I\\nremember rightly, there were more than twenty people up there. It was\\nso high that the ascent was made by ladder. The huge vehicle was full\\neverywhere, inside and out. Five other diligences left at the same time,\\nall full. We had engaged our seats two days beforehand, to make sure,\\nand paid the regulation price, five dollars each; but the rest of the\\ncompany were wiser; they had trusted Baedeker, and waited; consequently\\nsome of them got their seats for one or two dollars. Baedeker knows\\nall about hotels, railway and diligence companies, and speaks his mind\\nfreely. He is a trustworthy friend of the traveler.\\n\\nWe never saw Mont Blanc at his best until we were many miles away; then\\nhe lifted his majestic proportions high into the heavens, all white\\nand cold and solemn, and made the rest of the world seem little and\\nplebeian, and cheap and trivial.\\n\\nAs he passed out of sight at last, an old Englishman settled himself in\\nhis seat and said:\\n\\n\"Well, I am satisfied, I have seen the principal features of Swiss\\nscenery--Mont Blanc and the goiter--now for home!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVII\\n\\n[Queer European Manners]\\n\\nWe spent a few pleasant restful days at Geneva, that delightful city\\nwhere accurate time-pieces are made for all the rest of the world, but\\nwhose own clocks never give the correct time of day by any accident.\\n\\nGeneva is filled with pretty shops, and the shops are filled with the\\nmost enticing gimcrackery, but if one enters one of these places he is\\nat once pounced upon, and followed up, and so persecuted to buy this,\\nthat, and the other thing, that he is very grateful to get out again,\\nand is not at all apt to repeat his experiment. The shopkeepers of the\\nsmaller sort, in Geneva, are as troublesome and persistent as are\\nthe salesmen of that monster hive in Paris, the Grands Magasins du\\nLouvre--an establishment where ill-mannered pestering, pursuing, and\\ninsistence have been reduced to a science.\\n\\nIn Geneva, prices in the smaller shops are very elastic--that is another\\nbad feature. I was looking in at a window at a very pretty string of\\nbeads, suitable for a child. I was only admiring them; I had no use for\\nthem; I hardly ever wear beads. The shopwoman came out and offered them\\nto me for thirty-five francs. I said it was cheap, but I did not need\\nthem.\\n\\n\"Ah, but monsieur, they are so beautiful!\"\\n\\nI confessed it, but said they were not suitable for one of my age and\\nsimplicity of character. She darted in and brought them out and tried to\\nforce them into my hands, saying:\\n\\n\"Ah, but only see how lovely they are! Surely monsieur will take them;\\nmonsieur shall have them for thirty francs. There, I have said it--it is\\na loss, but one must live.\"\\n\\nI dropped my hands, and tried to move her to respect my unprotected\\nsituation. But no, she dangled the beads in the sun before my face,\\nexclaiming, \"Ah, monsieur _cannot_ resist them!\" She hung them on my\\ncoat button, folded her hand resignedly, and said: \"Gone,--and for\\nthirty francs, the lovely things--it is incredible!--but the good God\\nwill sanctify the sacrifice to me.\"\\n\\nI removed them gently, returned them, and walked away, shaking my head\\nand smiling a smile of silly embarrassment while the passers-by halted\\nto observe. The woman leaned out of her door, shook the beads, and\\nscreamed after me:\\n\\n\"Monsieur shall have them for twenty-eight!\"\\n\\nI shook my head.\\n\\n\"Twenty-seven! It is a cruel loss, it is ruin--but take them, only take\\nthem.\"\\n\\nI still retreated, still wagging my head.\\n\\n\"_Mon Dieu_, they shall even go for twenty-six! There, I have said it.\\nCome!\"\\n\\nI wagged another negative. A nurse and a little English girl had been\\nnear me, and were following me, now. The shopwoman ran to the nurse,\\nthrust the beads into her hands, and said:\\n\\n\"Monsieur shall have them for twenty-five! Take them to the hotel--he\\nshall send me the money tomorrow--next day--when he likes.\" Then to the\\nchild: \"When thy father sends me the money, come thou also, my angel,\\nand thou shall have something oh so pretty!\"\\n\\nI was thus providentially saved. The nurse refused the beads squarely\\nand firmly, and that ended the matter.\\n\\nThe \"sights\" of Geneva are not numerous. I made one attempt to hunt up\\nthe houses once inhabited by those two disagreeable people, Rousseau and\\nCalvin, but I had no success. Then I concluded to go home. I found\\nit was easier to propose to do that than to do it; for that town is a\\nbewildering place. I got lost in a tangle of narrow and crooked streets,\\nand stayed lost for an hour or two. Finally I found a street which\\nlooked somewhat familiar, and said to myself, \"Now I am at home, I\\njudge.\" But I was wrong; this was \"_Hell_ street.\" Presently I found\\nanother place which had a familiar look, and said to myself, \"Now I am\\nat home, sure.\" It was another error. This was \"_Purgatory_ street.\"\\nAfter a little I said, \"_now_ I\\'ve got the right place, anyway ... no,\\nthis is \\'_Paradise_ street\\'; I\\'m further from home than I was in the\\nbeginning.\" Those were queer names--Calvin was the author of them,\\nlikely. \"Hell\" and \"Purgatory\" fitted those two streets like a glove,\\nbut the \"Paradise\" appeared to be sarcastic.\\n\\nI came out on the lake-front, at last, and then I knew where I was.\\nI was walking along before the glittering jewelry shops when I saw a\\ncurious performance. A lady passed by, and a trim dandy lounged across\\nthe walk in such an apparently carefully timed way as to bring himself\\nexactly in front of her when she got to him; he made no offer to step\\nout of the way; he did not apologize; he did not even notice her. She\\nhad to stop still and let him lounge by. I wondered if he had done that\\npiece of brutality purposely. He strolled to a chair and seated himself\\nat a small table; two or three other males were sitting at similar\\ntables sipping sweetened water. I waited; presently a youth came by, and\\nthis fellow got up and served him the same trick. Still, it did not seem\\npossible that any one could do such a thing deliberately. To satisfy my\\ncuriosity I went around the block, and, sure enough, as I approached, at\\na good round speed, he got up and lounged lazily across my path, fouling\\nmy course exactly at the right moment to receive all my weight. This\\nproved that his previous performances had not been accidental, but\\nintentional.\\n\\nI saw that dandy\\'s curious game played afterward, in Paris, but not\\nfor amusement; not with a motive of any sort, indeed, but simply from a\\nselfish indifference to other people\\'s comfort and rights. One does not\\nsee it as frequently in Paris as he might expect to, for there the law\\nsays, in effect, \"It is the business of the weak to get out of the way\\nof the strong.\" We fine a cabman if he runs over a citizen; Paris fines\\nthe citizen for being run over. At least so everybody says--but I saw\\nsomething which caused me to doubt; I saw a horseman run over an old\\nwoman one day--the police arrested him and took him away. That looked as\\nif they meant to punish him.\\n\\nIt will not do for me to find merit in American manners--for are they\\nnot the standing butt for the jests of critical and polished Europe?\\nStill, I must venture to claim one little matter of superiority in our\\nmanners; a lady may traverse our streets all day, going and coming as\\nshe chooses, and she will never be molested by any man; but if a lady,\\nunattended, walks abroad in the streets of London, even at noonday, she\\nwill be pretty likely to be accosted and insulted--and not by drunken\\nsailors, but by men who carry the look and wear the dress of gentlemen.\\nIt is maintained that these people are not gentlemen, but are a lower\\nsort, disguised as gentlemen. The case of Colonel Valentine Baker\\nobstructs that argument, for a man cannot become an officer in the\\nBritish army except he hold the rank of gentleman. This person, finding\\nhimself alone in a railway compartment with an unprotected girl--but\\nit is an atrocious story, and doubtless the reader remembers it well\\nenough. London must have been more or less accustomed to Bakers, and the\\nways of Bakers, else London would have been offended and excited. Baker\\nwas \"imprisoned\"--in a parlor; and he could not have been more visited,\\nor more overwhelmed with attentions, if he had committed six murders and\\nthen--while the gallows was preparing--\"got religion\"--after the manner\\nof the holy Charles Peace, of saintly memory. Arkansaw--it seems a\\nlittle indelicate to be trumpeting forth our own superiorities, and\\ncomparisons are always odious, but still--Arkansaw would certainly have\\nhanged Baker. I do not say she would have tried him first, but she would\\nhave hanged him, anyway.\\n\\nEven the most degraded woman can walk our streets unmolested, her sex\\nand her weakness being her sufficient protection. She will encounter\\nless polish than she would in the old world, but she will run across\\nenough humanity to make up for it.\\n\\nThe music of a donkey awoke us early in the morning, and we rose up and\\nmade ready for a pretty formidable walk--to Italy; but the road was so\\nlevel that we took the train.. We lost a good deal of time by this, but\\nit was no matter, we were not in a hurry. We were four hours going to\\nChamb`ery. The Swiss trains go upward of three miles an hour, in places,\\nbut they are quite safe.\\n\\nThat aged French town of Chambry was as quaint and crooked as\\nHeilbronn. A drowsy reposeful quiet reigned in the back streets which\\nmade strolling through them very pleasant, barring the almost unbearable\\nheat of the sun. In one of these streets, which was eight feet wide,\\ngracefully curved, and built up with small antiquated houses, I saw\\nthree fat hogs lying asleep, and a boy (also asleep) taking care of\\nthem.\\n\\nFrom queer old-fashioned windows along the curve projected boxes of\\nbright flowers, and over the edge of one of these boxes hung the head\\nand shoulders of a cat--asleep. The five sleeping creatures were the\\nonly living things visible in that street. There was not a sound;\\nabsolute stillness prevailed. It was Sunday; one is not used to\\nsuch dreamy Sundays on the continent. In our part of the town it was\\ndifferent that night. A regiment of brown and battered soldiers had\\narrived home from Algiers, and I judged they got thirsty on the way.\\nThey sang and drank till dawn, in the pleasant open air.\\n\\nWe left for Turin at ten the next morning by a railway which was\\nprofusely decorated with tunnels. We forgot to take a lantern along,\\nconsequently we missed all the scenery. Our compartment was full. A\\nponderous tow-headed Swiss woman, who put on many fine-lady airs, but\\nwas evidently more used to washing linen than wearing it, sat in a\\ncorner seat and put her legs across into the opposite one, propping them\\nintermediately with her up-ended valise. In the seat thus pirated, sat\\ntwo Americans, greatly incommoded by that woman\\'s majestic coffin-clad\\nfeet. One of them begged, politely, to remove them. She opened her wide\\neyes and gave him a stare, but answered nothing. By and by he proferred\\nhis request again, with great respectfulness. She said, in good English,\\nand in a deeply offended tone, that she had paid her passage and was not\\ngoing to be bullied out of her \"rights\" by ill-bred foreigners, even if\\nshe was alone and unprotected.\\n\\n\"But I have rights, also, madam. My ticket entitles me to a seat, but\\nyou are occupying half of it.\"\\n\\n\"I will not talk with you, sir. What right have you to speak to me? I\\ndo not know you. One would know you came from a land where there are no\\ngentlemen. No _gentleman_ would treat a lady as you have treated me.\"\\n\\n\"I come from a region where a lady would hardly give me the same\\nprovocation.\"\\n\\n\"You have insulted me, sir! You have intimated that I am not a lady--and\\nI hope I am _not_ one, after the pattern of your country.\"\\n\\n\"I beg that you will give yourself no alarm on that head, madam; but at\\nthe same time I must insist--always respectfully--that you let me have\\nmy seat.\"\\n\\nHere the fragile laundress burst into tears and sobs.\\n\\n\"I never was so insulted before! Never, never! It is shameful, it is\\nbrutal, it is base, to bully and abuse an unprotected lady who has\\nlost the use of her limbs and cannot put her feet to the floor without\\nagony!\"\\n\\n\"Good heavens, madam, why didn\\'t you say that at first! I offer a\\nthousand pardons. And I offer them most sincerely. I did not know--I\\n_could_ not know--anything was the matter. You are most welcome to the\\nseat, and would have been from the first if I had only known. I am truly\\nsorry it all happened, I do assure you.\"\\n\\nBut he couldn\\'t get a word of forgiveness out of her. She simply sobbed\\nand sniffed in a subdued but wholly unappeasable way for two long hours,\\nmeantime crowding the man more than ever with her undertaker-furniture\\nand paying no sort of attention to his frequent and humble little\\nefforts to do something for her comfort. Then the train halted at the\\nItalian line and she hopped up and marched out of the car with as firm a\\nleg as any washerwoman of all her tribe! And how sick I was, to see how\\nshe had fooled me.\\n\\nTurin is a very fine city. In the matter of roominess it transcends\\nanything that was ever dreamed of before, I fancy. It sits in the midst\\nof a vast dead-level, and one is obliged to imagine that land may be\\nhad for the asking, and no taxes to pay, so lavishly do they use it. The\\nstreets are extravagantly wide, the paved squares are prodigious, the\\nhouses are huge and handsome, and compacted into uniform blocks that\\nstretch away as straight as an arrow, into the distance. The sidewalks\\nare about as wide as ordinary European _streets_, and are covered over\\nwith a double arcade supported on great stone piers or columns. One\\nwalks from one end to the other of these spacious streets, under shelter\\nall the time, and all his course is lined with the prettiest of shops\\nand the most inviting dining-houses.\\n\\nThere is a wide and lengthy court, glittering with the most wickedly\\nenticing shops, which is roofed with glass, high aloft overhead, and\\npaved with soft-toned marbles laid in graceful figures; and at night\\nwhen the place is brilliant with gas and populous with a sauntering and\\nchatting and laughing multitude of pleasure-seekers, it is a spectacle\\nworth seeing.\\n\\nEverything is on a large scale; the public buildings, for instance--and\\nthey are architecturally imposing, too, as well as large. The big\\nsquares have big bronze monuments in them. At the hotel they gave us\\nrooms that were alarming, for size, and parlor to match. It was well the\\nweather required no fire in the parlor, for I think one might as well\\nhave tried to warm a park. The place would have a warm look, though, in\\nany weather, for the window-curtains were of red silk damask, and the\\nwalls were covered with the same fire-hued goods--so, also, were the\\nfour sofas and the brigade of chairs. The furniture, the ornaments, the\\nchandeliers, the carpets, were all new and bright and costly. We did not\\nneed a parlor at all, but they said it belonged to the two bedrooms and\\nwe might use it if we chose. Since it was to cost nothing, we were not\\naverse to using it, of course.\\n\\nTurin must surely read a good deal, for it has more book-stores to the\\nsquare rod than any other town I know of. And it has its own share of\\nmilitary folk. The Italian officers\\' uniforms are very much the most\\nbeautiful I have ever seen; and, as a general thing, the men in them\\nwere as handsome as the clothes. They were not large men, but they had\\nfine forms, fine features, rich olive complexions, and lustrous black\\neyes.\\n\\nFor several weeks I had been culling all the information I could about\\nItaly, from tourists. The tourists were all agreed upon one thing--one\\nmust expect to be cheated at every turn by the Italians. I took an\\nevening walk in Turin, and presently came across a little Punch and Judy\\nshow in one of the great squares. Twelve or fifteen people constituted\\nthe audience. This miniature theater was not much bigger than a man\\'s\\ncoffin stood on end; the upper part was open and displayed a\\ntinseled parlor--a good-sized handkerchief would have answered for a\\ndrop-curtain; the footlights consisted of a couple of candle-ends an\\ninch long; various manikins the size of dolls appeared on the stage and\\nmade long speeches at each other, gesticulating a good deal, and they\\ngenerally had a fight before they got through. They were worked by\\nstrings from above, and the illusion was not perfect, for one saw not\\nonly the strings but the brawny hand that manipulated them--and the\\nactors and actresses all talked in the same voice, too. The audience\\nstood in front of the theater, and seemed to enjoy the performance\\nheartily.\\n\\nWhen the play was done, a youth in his shirt-sleeves started around with\\na small copper saucer to make a collection. I did not know how much to\\nput in, but thought I would be guided by my predecessors. Unluckily, I\\nonly had two of these, and they did not help me much because they did\\nnot put in anything. I had no Italian money, so I put in a small Swiss\\ncoin worth about ten cents. The youth finished his collection trip and\\nemptied the result on the stage; he had some very animated talk with\\nthe concealed manager, then he came working his way through the little\\ncrowd--seeking me, I thought. I had a mind to slip away, but concluded\\nI wouldn\\'t; I would stand my ground, and confront the villainy, whatever\\nit was. The youth stood before me and held up that Swiss coin, sure\\nenough, and said something. I did not understand him, but I judged he\\nwas requiring Italian money of me. The crowd gathered close, to listen.\\nI was irritated, and said--in English, of course:\\n\\n\"I know it\\'s Swiss, but you\\'ll take that or none. I haven\\'t any other.\"\\n\\nHe tried to put the coin in my hand, and spoke again. I drew my hand\\naway, and said:\\n\\n\"_No_, sir. I know all about you people. You can\\'t play any of your\\nfraudful tricks on me. If there is a discount on that coin, I am sorry,\\nbut I am not going to make it good. I noticed that some of the audience\\ndidn\\'t pay you anything at all. You let them go, without a word, but you\\ncome after me because you think I\\'m a stranger and will put up with\\nan extortion rather than have a scene. But you are mistaken this\\ntime--you\\'ll take that Swiss money or none.\"\\n\\nThe youth stood there with the coin in his fingers, nonplused and\\nbewildered; of course he had not understood a word. An English-speaking\\nItalian spoke up, now, and said:\\n\\n\"You are misunderstanding the boy. He does not mean any harm. He did\\nnot suppose you gave him so much money purposely, so he hurried back to\\nreturn you the coin lest you might get away before you discovered your\\nmistake. Take it, and give him a penny--that will make everything smooth\\nagain.\"\\n\\nI probably blushed, then, for there was occasion. Through the\\ninterpreter I begged the boy\\'s pardon, but I nobly refused to take back\\nthe ten cents. I said I was accustomed to squandering large sums in that\\nway--it was the kind of person I was. Then I retired to make a note to\\nthe effect that in Italy persons connected with the drama do not cheat.\\n\\nThe episode with the showman reminds me of a dark chapter in my history.\\nI once robbed an aged and blind beggar-woman of four dollars--in a\\nchurch. It happened this way. When I was out with the Innocents Abroad,\\nthe ship stopped in the Russian port of Odessa and I went ashore, with\\nothers, to view the town. I got separated from the rest, and wandered\\nabout alone, until late in the afternoon, when I entered a Greek church\\nto see what it was like. When I was ready to leave, I observed two\\nwrinkled old women standing stiffly upright against the inner wall, near\\nthe door, with their brown palms open to receive alms. I contributed to\\nthe nearer one, and passed out. I had gone fifty yards, perhaps, when it\\noccurred to me that I must remain ashore all night, as I had heard that\\nthe ship\\'s business would carry her away at four o\\'clock and keep her\\naway until morning. It was a little after four now. I had come ashore\\nwith only two pieces of money, both about the same size, but differing\\nlargely in value--one was a French gold piece worth four dollars, the\\nother a Turkish coin worth two cents and a half. With a sudden and\\nhorrified misgiving, I put my hand in my pocket, now, and sure enough, I\\nfetched out that Turkish penny!\\n\\nHere was a situation. A hotel would require pay in advance--I must walk\\nthe street all night, and perhaps be arrested as a suspicious character.\\nThere was but one way out of the difficulty--I flew back to the church,\\nand softly entered. There stood the old woman yet, and in the palm of\\nthe nearest one still lay my gold piece. I was grateful. I crept\\nclose, feeling unspeakably mean; I got my Turkish penny ready, and was\\nextending a trembling hand to make the nefarious exchange, when I heard\\na cough behind me. I jumped back as if I had been accused, and stood\\nquaking while a worshiper entered and passed up the aisle.\\n\\nI was there a year trying to steal that money; that is, it seemed a\\nyear, though, of course, it must have been much less. The worshipers\\nwent and came; there were hardly ever three in the church at once, but\\nthere was always one or more. Every time I tried to commit my crime\\nsomebody came in or somebody started out, and I was prevented; but at\\nlast my opportunity came; for one moment there was nobody in the church\\nbut the two beggar-women and me. I whipped the gold piece out of the\\npoor old pauper\\'s palm and dropped my Turkish penny in its place. Poor\\nold thing, she murmured her thanks--they smote me to the heart. Then I\\nsped away in a guilty hurry, and even when I was a mile from the church\\nI was still glancing back, every moment, to see if I was being pursued.\\n\\nThat experience has been of priceless value and benefit to me; for I\\nresolved then, that as long as I lived I would never again rob a blind\\nbeggar-woman in a church; and I have always kept my word. The most\\npermanent lessons in morals are those which come, not of booky teaching,\\nbut of experience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLVIII\\n\\n[Beauty of Women--and of Old Masters]\\n\\nIn Milan we spent most of our time in the vast and beautiful Arcade or\\nGallery, or whatever it is called. Blocks of tall new buildings of the\\nmost sumptuous sort, rich with decoration and graced with statues, the\\nstreets between these blocks roofed over with glass at a great height,\\nthe pavements all of smooth and variegated marble, arranged in tasteful\\npatterns--little tables all over these marble streets, people sitting\\nat them, eating, drinking, or smoking--crowds of other people strolling\\nby--such is the Arcade. I should like to live in it all the time. The\\nwindows of the sumptuous restaurants stand open, and one breakfasts\\nthere and enjoys the passing show.\\n\\nWe wandered all over the town, enjoying whatever was going on in the\\nstreets. We took one omnibus ride, and as I did not speak Italian and\\ncould not ask the price, I held out some copper coins to the conductor,\\nand he took two. Then he went and got his tariff card and showed me\\nthat he had taken only the right sum. So I made a note--Italian omnibus\\nconductors do not cheat.\\n\\nNear the Cathedral I saw another instance of probity. An old man was\\npeddling dolls and toy fans. Two small American children bought fans,\\nand one gave the old man a franc and three copper coins, and both\\nstarted away; but they were called back, and the franc and one of the\\ncoppers were restored to them. Hence it is plain that in Italy, parties\\nconnected with the drama and the omnibus and the toy interests do not\\ncheat.\\n\\nThe stocks of goods in the shops were not extensive, generally. In the\\nvestibule of what seemed to be a clothing store, we saw eight or ten\\nwooden dummies grouped together, clothed in woolen business suits and\\neach marked with its price. One suit was marked forty-five francs--nine\\ndollars. Harris stepped in and said he wanted a suit like that. Nothing\\neasier: the old merchant dragged in the dummy, brushed him off with a\\nbroom, stripped him, and shipped the clothes to the hotel. He said he\\ndid not keep two suits of the same kind in stock, but manufactured a\\nsecond when it was needed to reclothe the dummy.\\n\\nIn another quarter we found six Italians engaged in a violent quarrel.\\nThey danced fiercely about, gesticulating with their heads, their arms,\\ntheir legs, their whole bodies; they would rush forward occasionally\\nwith a sudden access of passion and shake their fists in each other\\'s\\nvery faces. We lost half an hour there, waiting to help cord up the\\ndead, but they finally embraced each other affectionately, and the\\ntrouble was over. The episode was interesting, but we could not have\\nafforded all the time to it if we had known nothing was going to come of\\nit but a reconciliation. Note made--in Italy, people who quarrel cheat\\nthe spectator.\\n\\nWe had another disappointment afterward. We approached a deeply\\ninterested crowd, and in the midst of it found a fellow wildly\\nchattering and gesticulating over a box on the ground which was covered\\nwith a piece of old blanket. Every little while he would bend down\\nand take hold of the edge of the blanket with the extreme tips of his\\nfingertips, as if to show there was no deception--chattering away all\\nthe while--but always, just as I was expecting to see a wonder feat of\\nlegerdemain, he would let go the blanket and rise to explain further.\\nHowever, at last he uncovered the box and got out a spoon with a liquid\\nin it, and held it fair and frankly around, for people to see that it\\nwas all right and he was taking no advantage--his chatter became more\\nexcited than ever. I supposed he was going to set fire to the liquid\\nand swallow it, so I was greatly wrought up and interested. I got a cent\\nready in one hand and a florin in the other, intending to give him the\\nformer if he survived and the latter if he killed himself--for his loss\\nwould be my gain in a literary way, and I was willing to pay a fair\\nprice for the item--but this impostor ended his intensely moving\\nperformance by simply adding some powder to the liquid and polishing\\nthe spoon! Then he held it aloft, and he could not have shown a wilder\\nexultation if he had achieved an immortal miracle. The crowd applauded\\nin a gratified way, and it seemed to me that history speaks the truth\\nwhen it says these children of the south are easily entertained.\\n\\nWe spent an impressive hour in the noble cathedral, where long shafts\\nof tinted light were cleaving through the solemn dimness from the lofty\\nwindows and falling on a pillar here, a picture there, and a kneeling\\nworshiper yonder. The organ was muttering, censers were swinging,\\ncandles were glinting on the distant altar and robed priests were filing\\nsilently past them; the scene was one to sweep all frivolous thoughts\\naway and steep the soul in a holy calm. A trim young American lady\\npaused a yard or two from me, fixed her eyes on the mellow sparks\\nflecking the far-off altar, bent her head reverently a moment, then\\nstraightened up, kicked her train into the air with her heel, caught it\\ndeftly in her hand, and marched briskly out.\\n\\nWe visited the picture-galleries and the other regulation \"sights\" of\\nMilan--not because I wanted to write about them again, but to see if\\nI had learned anything in twelve years. I afterward visited the great\\ngalleries of Rome and Florence for the same purpose. I found I had\\nlearned one thing. When I wrote about the Old Masters before, I said\\nthe copies were better than the originals. That was a mistake of large\\ndimensions. The Old Masters were still unpleasing to me, but they were\\ntruly divine contrasted with the copies. The copy is to the original as\\nthe pallid, smart, inane new wax-work group is to the vigorous, earnest,\\ndignified group of living men and women whom it professes to duplicate.\\nThere is a mellow richness, a subdued color, in the old pictures, which\\nis to the eye what muffled and mellowed sound is to the ear. That is the\\nmerit which is most loudly praised in the old picture, and is the one\\nwhich the copy most conspicuously lacks, and which the copyist must not\\nhope to compass. It was generally conceded by the artists with whom I\\ntalked, that that subdued splendor, that mellow richness, is imparted to\\nthe picture by _age_. Then why should we worship the Old Master for it,\\nwho didn\\'t impart it, instead of worshiping Old Time, who did? Perhaps\\nthe picture was a clanging bell, until Time muffled it and sweetened it.\\n\\nIn conversation with an artist in Venice, I asked: \"What is it that\\npeople see in the Old Masters? I have been in the Doge\\'s palace and I\\nsaw several acres of very bad drawing, very bad perspective, and very\\nincorrect proportions. Paul Veronese\\'s dogs to not resemble dogs; all\\nthe horses look like bladders on legs; one man had a _right_ leg on\\nthe left side of his body; in the large picture where the Emperor\\n(Barbarossa?) is prostrate before the Pope, there are three men in the\\nforeground who are over thirty feet high, if one may judge by the size\\nof a kneeling little boy in the center of the foreground; and according\\nto the same scale, the Pope is seven feet high and the Doge is a\\nshriveled dwarf of four feet.\"\\n\\nThe artist said:\\n\\n\"Yes, the Old Masters often drew badly; they did not care much for truth\\nand exactness in minor details; but after all, in spite of bad drawing,\\nbad perspective, bad proportions, and a choice of subjects which no\\nlonger appeal to people as strongly as they did three hundred years ago,\\nthere is a _something_ about their pictures which is divine--a something\\nwhich is above and beyond the art of any epoch since--a something which\\nwould be the despair of artists but that they never hope or expect to\\nattain it, and therefore do not worry about it.\"\\n\\nThat is what he said--and he said what he believed; and not only\\nbelieved, but felt.\\n\\nReasoning--especially reasoning, without technical knowledge--must be\\nput aside, in cases of this kind. It cannot assist the inquirer. It\\nwill lead him, in the most logical progression, to what, in the eyes of\\nartists, would be a most illogical conclusion. Thus: bad drawing, bad\\nproportion, bad perspective, indifference to truthful detail, color\\nwhich gets its merit from time, and not from the artist--these things\\nconstitute the Old Master; conclusion, the Old Master was a bad painter,\\nthe Old Master was not an Old Master at all, but an Old Apprentice. Your\\nfriend the artist will grant your premises, but deny your conclusion;\\nhe will maintain that notwithstanding this formidable list of confessed\\ndefects, there is still a something that is divine and unapproachable\\nabout the Old Master, and that there is no arguing the fact away by any\\nsystem of reasoning whatsoever.\\n\\nI can believe that. There are women who have an indefinable charm in\\ntheir faces which makes them beautiful to their intimates, but a cold\\nstranger who tried to reason the matter out and find this beauty would\\nfail. He would say of one of these women: This chin is too short, this\\nnose is too long, this forehead is too high, this hair is too red, this\\ncomplexion is too pallid, the perspective of the entire composition\\nis incorrect; conclusion, the woman is not beautiful. But her nearest\\nfriend might say, and say truly, \"Your premises are right, your logic\\nis faultless, but your conclusion is wrong, nevertheless; she is an Old\\nMaster--she is beautiful, but only to such as know her; it is a beauty\\nwhich cannot be formulated, but it is there, just the same.\"\\n\\nI found more pleasure in contemplating the Old Masters this time than\\nI did when I was in Europe in former years, but still it was a calm\\npleasure; there was nothing overheated about it. When I was in Venice\\nbefore, I think I found no picture which stirred me much, but this time\\nthere were two which enticed me to the Doge\\'s palace day after day, and\\nkept me there hours at a time. One of these was Tintoretto\\'s three-acre\\npicture in the Great Council Chamber. When I saw it twelve years ago\\nI was not strongly attracted to it--the guide told me it was an\\ninsurrection in heaven--but this was an error.\\n\\nThe movement of this great work is very fine. There are ten thousand\\nfigures, and they are all doing something. There is a wonderful \"go\"\\nto the whole composition. Some of the figures are driving headlong\\ndownward, with clasped hands, others are swimming through the\\ncloud-shoals--some on their faces, some on their backs--great\\nprocessions of bishops, martyrs, and angels are pouring swiftly\\ncenterward from various outlying directions--everywhere is enthusiastic\\njoy, there is rushing movement everywhere. There are fifteen or twenty\\nfigures scattered here and there, with books, but they cannot keep their\\nattention on their reading--they offer the books to others, but no one\\nwishes to read, now. The Lion of St. Mark is there with his book; St.\\nMark is there with his pen uplifted; he and the Lion are looking\\neach other earnestly in the face, disputing about the way to spell a\\nword--the Lion looks up in rapt admiration while St. Mark spells. This\\nis wonderfully interpreted by the artist. It is the master-stroke of\\nthis imcomparable painting.\\n\\nI visited the place daily, and never grew tired of looking at that\\ngrand picture. As I have intimated, the movement is almost unimaginably\\nvigorous; the figures are singing, hosannahing, and many are blowing\\ntrumpets. So vividly is noise suggested, that spectators who become\\nabsorbed in the picture almost always fall to shouting comments in each\\nother\\'s ears, making ear-trumpets of their curved hands, fearing they\\nmay not otherwise be heard. One often sees a tourist, with the eloquent\\ntears pouring down his cheeks, funnel his hands at his wife\\'s ear, and\\nhears him roar through them, \"__Oh, to be there and at rest__!\"\\n\\nNone but the supremely great in art can produce effects like these with\\nthe silent brush.\\n\\nTwelve years ago I could not have appreciated this picture. One year ago\\nI could not have appreciated it. My study of Art in Heidelberg has been\\na noble education to me. All that I am today in Art, I owe to that.\\n\\nThe other great work which fascinated me was Bassano\\'s immortal Hair\\nTrunk. This is in the Chamber of the Council of Ten. It is in one of\\nthe three forty-foot pictures which decorate the walls of the room.\\nThe composition of this picture is beyond praise. The Hair Trunk is not\\nhurled at the stranger\\'s head--so to speak--as the chief feature of an\\nimmortal work so often is; no, it is carefully guarded from prominence,\\nit is subordinated, it is restrained, it is most deftly and cleverly\\nheld in reserve, it is most cautiously and ingeniously led up to, by the\\nmaster, and consequently when the spectator reaches it at last, he\\nis taken unawares, he is unprepared, and it bursts upon him with a\\nstupefying surprise.\\n\\nOne is lost in wonder at all the thought and care which this elaborate\\nplanning must have cost. A general glance at the picture could never\\nsuggest that there was a hair trunk in it; the Hair Trunk is not\\nmentioned in the title even--which is, \"Pope Alexander III. and the Doge\\nZiani, the Conqueror of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa\"; you see,\\nthe title is actually utilized to help divert attention from the Trunk;\\nthus, as I say, nothing suggests the presence of the Trunk, by any hint,\\nyet everything studiedly leads up to it, step by step. Let us examine\\ninto this, and observe the exquisitely artful artlessness of the plan.\\n\\nAt the extreme left end of the picture are a couple of women, one of\\nthem with a child looking over her shoulder at a wounded man sitting\\nwith bandaged head on the ground. These people seem needless, but no,\\nthey are there for a purpose; one cannot look at them without seeing\\nthe gorgeous procession of grandees, bishops, halberdiers, and\\nbanner-bearers which is passing along behind them; one cannot see the\\nprocession without feeling the curiosity to follow it and learn whither\\nit is going; it leads him to the Pope, in the center of the picture, who\\nis talking with the bonnetless Doge--talking tranquilly, too, although\\nwithin twelve feet of them a man is beating a drum, and not far from the\\ndrummer two persons are blowing horns, and many horsemen are plunging\\nand rioting about--indeed, twenty-two feet of this great work is all a\\ndeep and happy holiday serenity and Sunday-school procession, and then\\nwe come suddenly upon eleven and one-half feet of turmoil and racket and\\ninsubordination. This latter state of things is not an accident, it has\\nits purpose. But for it, one would linger upon the Pope and the Doge,\\nthinking them to be the motive and supreme feature of the picture;\\nwhereas one is drawn along, almost unconsciously, to see what the\\ntrouble is about. Now at the very _end_ of this riot, within four feet\\nof the end of the picture, and full thirty-six feet from the beginning\\nof it, the Hair Trunk bursts with an electrifying suddenness upon the\\nspectator, in all its matchless perfection, and the great master\\'s\\ntriumph is sweeping and complete. From that moment no other thing in\\nthose forty feet of canvas has any charm; one sees the Hair Trunk, and\\nthe Hair Trunk only--and to see it is to worship it. Bassano even placed\\nobjects in the immediate vicinity of the Supreme Feature whose pretended\\npurpose was to divert attention from it yet a little longer and thus\\ndelay and augment the surprise; for instance, to the right of it he has\\nplaced a stooping man with a cap so red that it is sure to hold the eye\\nfor a moment--to the left of it, some six feet away, he has placed a\\nred-coated man on an inflated horse, and that coat plucks your eye\\nto that locality the next moment--then, between the Trunk and the red\\nhorseman he has intruded a man, naked to his waist, who is carrying\\na fancy flour-sack on the middle of his back instead of on his\\nshoulder--this admirable feat interests you, of course--keeps you at\\nbay a little longer, like a sock or a jacket thrown to the pursuing\\nwolf--but at last, in spite of all distractions and detentions, the eye\\nof even the most dull and heedless spectator is sure to fall upon the\\nWorld\\'s Masterpiece, and in that moment he totters to his chair or leans\\nupon his guide for support.\\n\\nDescriptions of such a work as this must necessarily be imperfect, yet\\nthey are of value. The top of the Trunk is arched; the arch is a perfect\\nhalf-circle, in the Roman style of architecture, for in the then\\nrapid decadence of Greek art, the rising influence of Rome was already\\nbeginning to be felt in the art of the Republic. The Trunk is bound or\\nbordered with leather all around where the lid joins the main body. Many\\ncritics consider this leather too cold in tone; but I consider this its\\nhighest merit, since it was evidently made so to emphasize by contrast\\nthe impassioned fervor of the hasp. The highlights in this part of the\\nwork are cleverly managed, the _motif_ is admirably subordinated to the\\nground tints, and the technique is very fine. The brass nail-heads are\\nin the purest style of the early Renaissance. The strokes, here, are\\nvery firm and bold--every nail-head is a portrait. The handle on the\\nend of the Trunk has evidently been retouched--I think, with a piece of\\nchalk--but one can still see the inspiration of the Old Master in the\\ntranquil, almost too tranquil, hang of it. The hair of this Trunk\\nis _real_ hair--so to speak--white in patches, brown in patches. The\\ndetails are finely worked out; the repose proper to hair in a recumbent\\nand inactive attitude is charmingly expressed. There is a feeling about\\nthis part of the work which lifts it to the highest altitudes of art;\\nthe sense of sordid realism vanishes away--one recognizes that there is\\n_soul_ here.\\n\\nView this Trunk as you will, it is a gem, it is a marvel, it is a\\nmiracle. Some of the effects are very daring, approaching even to\\nthe boldest flights of the rococo, the sirocco, and the Byzantine\\nschools--yet the master\\'s hand never falters--it moves on, calm,\\nmajestic, confident--and, with that art which conceals art, it finally\\ncasts over the _tout ensemble_, by mysterious methods of its own,\\na subtle something which refines, subdues, etherealizes the arid\\ncomponents and endures them with the deep charm and gracious witchery of\\npoesy.\\n\\nAmong the art-treasures of Europe there are pictures which approach the\\nHair Trunk--there are two which may be said to equal it, possibly--but\\nthere is none that surpasses it. So perfect is the Hair Trunk that it\\nmoves even persons who ordinarily have no feeling for art. When an Erie\\nbaggagemaster saw it two years ago, he could hardly keep from checking\\nit; and once when a customs inspector was brought into its presence,\\nhe gazed upon it in silent rapture for some moments, then slowly and\\nunconsciously placed one hand behind him with the palm uppermost, and\\ngot out his chalk with the other. These facts speak for themselves.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER XLIX\\n\\n[Hanged with a Golden Rope]\\n\\nOne lingers about the Cathedral a good deal, in Venice. There is a\\nstrong fascination about it--partly because it is so old, and partly\\nbecause it is so ugly. Too many of the world\\'s famous buildings fail of\\none chief virtue--harmony; they are made up of a methodless mixture\\nof the ugly and the beautiful; this is bad; it is confusing, it is\\nunrestful. One has a sense of uneasiness, of distress, without knowing\\nwhy. But one is calm before St. Mark\\'s, one is calm within it, one\\nwould be calm on top of it, calm in the cellar; for its details are\\nmasterfully ugly, no misplaced and impertinent beauties are intruded\\nanywhere; and the consequent result is a grand harmonious whole, of\\nsoothing, entrancing, tranquilizing, soul-satisfying ugliness. One\\'s\\nadmiration of a perfect thing always grows, never declines; and this is\\nthe surest evidence to him that it _is_ perfect. St. Mark\\'s is perfect.\\nTo me it soon grew to be so nobly, so augustly ugly, that it was\\ndifficult to stay away from it, even for a little while. Every time\\nits squat domes disappeared from my view, I had a despondent feeling;\\nwhenever they reappeared, I felt an honest rapture--I have not known any\\nhappier hours than those I daily spent in front of Florian\\'s,\\nlooking across the Great Square at it. Propped on its long row of low\\nthick-legged columns, its back knobbed with domes, it seemed like a vast\\nwarty bug taking a meditative walk.\\n\\nSt. Mark\\'s is not the oldest building in the world, of course, but it\\nseems the oldest, and looks the oldest--especially inside.\\n\\nWhen the ancient mosaics in its walls become damaged, they are repaired\\nbut not altered; the grotesque old pattern is preserved. Antiquity has\\na charm of its own, and to smarten it up would only damage it. One day\\nI was sitting on a red marble bench in the vestibule looking up at an\\nancient piece of apprentice-work, in mosaic, illustrative of the command\\nto \"multiply and replenish the earth.\" The Cathedral itself had seemed\\nvery old; but this picture was illustrating a period in history which\\nmade the building seem young by comparison. But I presently found an\\nantique which was older than either the battered Cathedral or the date\\nassigned to the piece of history; it was a spiral-shaped fossil as large\\nas the crown of a hat; it was embedded in the marble bench, and had\\nbeen sat upon by tourists until it was worn smooth. Contrasted with the\\ninconceivable antiquity of this modest fossil, those other things were\\nflippantly modern--jejune--mere matters of day-before-yesterday. The\\nsense of the oldness of the Cathedral vanished away under the influence\\nof this truly venerable presence.\\n\\nSt. Mark\\'s is monumental; it is an imperishable remembrancer of the\\nprofound and simple piety of the Middle Ages. Whoever could ravish a\\ncolumn from a pagan temple, did it and contributed his swag to this\\nChristian one. So this fane is upheld by several hundred acquisitions\\nprocured in that peculiar way. In our day it would be immoral to go on\\nthe highway to get bricks for a church, but it was no sin in the old\\ntimes. St. Mark\\'s was itself the victim of a curious robbery once. The\\nthing is set down in the history of Venice, but it might be smuggled\\ninto the Arabian Nights and not seem out of place there:\\n\\nNearly four hundred and fifty years ago, a Candian named Stammato, in\\nthe suite of a prince of the house of Este, was allowed to view the\\nriches of St. Mark\\'s. His sinful eye was dazzled and he hid himself\\nbehind an altar, with an evil purpose in his heart, but a priest\\ndiscovered him and turned him out. Afterward he got in again--by false\\nkeys, this time. He went there, night after night, and worked hard and\\npatiently, all alone, overcoming difficulty after difficulty with his\\ntoil, and at last succeeded in removing a great brick of the marble\\npaneling which walled the lower part of the treasury; this block he\\nfixed so that he could take it out and put it in at will. After\\nthat, for weeks, he spent all his midnights in his magnificent mine,\\ninspecting it in security, gloating over its marvels at his leisure, and\\nalways slipping back to his obscure lodgings before dawn, with a\\nduke\\'s ransom under his cloak. He did not need to grab, haphazard, and\\nrun--there was no hurry. He could make deliberate and well-considered\\nselections; he could consult his esthetic tastes. One comprehends how\\nundisturbed he was, and how safe from any danger of interruption,\\nwhen it is stated that he even carried off a unicorn\\'s horn--a mere\\ncuriosity--which would not pass through the egress entire, but had to\\nbe sawn in two--a bit of work which cost him hours of tedious labor. He\\ncontinued to store up his treasures at home until his occupation lost\\nthe charm of novelty and became monotonous; then he ceased from it,\\ncontented. Well he might be; for his collection, raised to modern\\nvalues, represented nearly fifty million dollars!\\n\\nHe could have gone home much the richest citizen of his country, and\\nit might have been years before the plunder was missed; but he was\\nhuman--he could not enjoy his delight alone, he must have somebody to\\ntalk about it with. So he exacted a solemn oath from a Candian noble\\nnamed Crioni, then led him to his lodgings and nearly took his breath\\naway with a sight of his glittering hoard. He detected a look in his\\nfriend\\'s face which excited his suspicion, and was about to slip a\\nstiletto into him when Crioni saved himself by explaining that that look\\nwas only an expression of supreme and happy astonishment. Stammato\\nmade Crioni a present of one of the state\\'s principal jewels--a huge\\ncarbuncle, which afterward figured in the Ducal cap of state--and the\\npair parted. Crioni went at once to the palace, denounced the criminal,\\nand handed over the carbuncle as evidence. Stammato was arrested, tried,\\nand condemned, with the old-time Venetian promptness. He was hanged\\nbetween the two great columns in the Piazza--with a gilded rope, out of\\ncompliment to his love of gold, perhaps. He got no good of his booty at\\nall--it was _all_ recovered.\\n\\nIn Venice we had a luxury which very seldom fell to our lot on the\\ncontinent--a home dinner with a private family. If one could always stop\\nwith private families, when traveling, Europe would have a charm which\\nit now lacks. As it is, one must live in the hotels, of course, and that\\nis a sorrowful business. A man accustomed to American food and American\\ndomestic cookery would not starve to death suddenly in Europe; but I\\nthink he would gradually waste away, and eventually die.\\n\\nHe would have to do without his accustomed morning meal. That is too\\nformidable a change altogether; he would necessarily suffer from it. He\\ncould get the shadow, the sham, the base counterfeit of that meal; but\\nit would do him no good, and money could not buy the reality.\\n\\nTo particularize: the average American\\'s simplest and commonest form of\\nbreakfast consists of coffee and beefsteak; well, in Europe, coffee is\\nan unknown beverage. You can get what the European hotel-keeper thinks\\nis coffee, but it resembles the real thing as hypocrisy resembles\\nholiness. It is a feeble, characterless, uninspiring sort of stuff, and\\nalmost as undrinkable as if it had been made in an American hotel. The\\nmilk used for it is what the French call \"Christian\" milk--milk which\\nhas been baptized.\\n\\nAfter a few months\\' acquaintance with European \"coffee,\" one\\'s mind\\nweakens, and his faith with it, and he begins to wonder if the rich\\nbeverage of home, with its clotted layer of yellow cream on top of it,\\nis not a mere dream, after all, and a thing which never existed.\\n\\nNext comes the European bread--fair enough, good enough, after a\\nfashion, but cold; cold and tough, and unsympathetic; and never any\\nchange, never any variety--always the same tiresome thing.\\n\\nNext, the butter--the sham and tasteless butter; no salt in it, and made\\nof goodness knows what.\\n\\nThen there is the beefsteak. They have it in Europe, but they don\\'t know\\nhow to cook it. Neither will they cut it right. It comes on the table in\\na small, round pewter platter. It lies in the center of this platter,\\nin a bordering bed of grease-soaked potatoes; it is the size, shape, and\\nthickness of a man\\'s hand with the thumb and fingers cut off. It is a\\nlittle overdone, is rather dry, it tastes pretty insipidly, it rouses no\\nenthusiasm.\\n\\nImagine a poor exile contemplating that inert thing; and imagine an\\nangel suddenly sweeping down out of a better land and setting before him\\na mighty porterhouse steak an inch and a half thick, hot and sputtering\\nfrom the griddle; dusted with a fragrant pepper; enriched with\\nlittle melting bits of butter of the most unimpeachable freshness and\\ngenuineness; the precious juices of the meat trickling out and joining\\nthe gravy, archipelagoed with mushrooms; a township or two of tender,\\nyellowish fat gracing an outlying district of this ample county of\\nbeefsteak; the long white bone which divides the sirloin from the\\ntenderloin still in its place; and imagine that the angel also adds a\\ngreat cup of American home-made coffee, with a cream a-froth on top,\\nsome real butter, firm and yellow and fresh, some smoking hot-biscuits,\\na plate of hot buckwheat cakes, with transparent syrup--could words\\ndescribe the gratitude of this exile?\\n\\nThe European dinner is better than the European breakfast, but it has\\nits faults and inferiorities; it does not satisfy. He comes to the table\\neager and hungry; he swallows his soup--there is an undefinable\\nlack about it somewhere; thinks the fish is going to be the thing he\\nwants--eats it and isn\\'t sure; thinks the next dish is perhaps the one\\nthat will hit the hungry place--tries it, and is conscious that there\\nwas a something wanting about it, also. And thus he goes on, from dish\\nto dish, like a boy after a butterfly which just misses getting caught\\nevery time it alights, but somehow doesn\\'t get caught after all; and at\\nthe end the exile and the boy have fared about alike; the one is full,\\nbut grievously unsatisfied, the other has had plenty of exercise, plenty\\nof interest, and a fine lot of hopes, but he hasn\\'t got any butterfly.\\nThere is here and there an American who will say he can remember rising\\nfrom a European table d\\'hte perfectly satisfied; but we must not\\noverlook the fact that there is also here and there an American who will\\nlie.\\n\\nThe number of dishes is sufficient; but then it is such a monotonous\\nvariety of _unstriking_ dishes. It is an inane dead-level of\\n\"fair-to-middling.\" There is nothing to _accent_ it. Perhaps if the\\nroast of mutton or of beef--a big, generous one--were brought on the\\ntable and carved in full view of the client, that might give the right\\nsense of earnestness and reality to the thing; but they don\\'t do that,\\nthey pass the sliced meat around on a dish, and so you are perfectly\\ncalm, it does not stir you in the least. Now a vast roast turkey,\\nstretched on the broad of his back, with his heels in the air and the\\nrich juices oozing from his fat sides ... but I may as well stop there,\\nfor they would not know how to cook him. They can\\'t even cook a chicken\\nrespectably; and as for carving it, they do that with a hatchet.\\n\\nThis is about the customary table d\\'hte bill in summer:\\n\\nSoup (characterless).\\n\\nFish--sole, salmon, or whiting--usually tolerably good.\\n\\nRoast--mutton or beef--tasteless--and some last year\\'s potatoes.\\n\\nA pate, or some other made dish--usually good--\"considering.\"\\n\\nOne vegetable--brought on in state, and all alone--usually insipid\\nlentils, or string-beans, or indifferent asparagus.\\n\\nRoast chicken, as tasteless as paper.\\n\\nLettuce-salad--tolerably good.\\n\\nDecayed strawberries or cherries.\\n\\nSometimes the apricots and figs are fresh, but this is no advantage, as\\nthese fruits are of no account anyway.\\n\\nThe grapes are generally good, and sometimes there is a tolerably good\\npeach, by mistake.\\n\\nThe variations of the above bill are trifling. After a fortnight one\\ndiscovers that the variations are only apparent, not real; in the third\\nweek you get what you had the first, and in the fourth the week you get\\nwhat you had the second. Three or four months of this weary sameness\\nwill kill the robustest appetite.\\n\\nIt has now been many months, at the present writing, since I have had\\na nourishing meal, but I shall soon have one--a modest, private affair,\\nall to myself. I have selected a few dishes, and made out a little bill\\nof fare, which will go home in the steamer that precedes me, and be hot\\nwhen I arrive--as follows:\\n\\nRadishes. Baked apples, with cream Fried oysters; stewed oysters.\\nFrogs. American coffee, with real cream. American butter. Fried chicken,\\nSouthern style. Porter-house steak. Saratoga potatoes. Broiled chicken,\\nAmerican style. Hot biscuits, Southern style. Hot wheat-bread, Southern\\nstyle. Hot buckwheat cakes. American toast. Clear maple syrup. Virginia\\nbacon, broiled.

All sorts of American pastry.\\n\\nFresh American fruits of all sorts, including strawberries which are\\nnot to be doled out as if they were jewelry, but in a more liberal way.\\nIce-water--not prepared in the ineffectual goblet, but in the sincere\\nand capable refrigerator.\\n\\nAmericans intending to spend a year or so in European hotels will\\ndo well to copy this bill and carry it along. They will find it an\\nexcellent thing to get up an appetite with, in the dispiriting presence\\nof the squalid table d\\'hte.\\n\\nForeigners cannot enjoy our food, I suppose, any more than we can\\nenjoy theirs. It is not strange; for tastes are made, not born. I might\\nglorify my bill of fare until I was tired; but after all, the Scotchman\\nwould shake his head and say, \"Where\\'s your haggis?\" and the Fijian\\nwould sigh and say, \"Where\\'s your missionary?\"\\n\\nI have a neat talent in matters pertaining to nourishment. This has\\nmet with professional recognition. I have often furnished recipes for\\ncook-books. Here are some designs for pies and things, which I recently\\nprepared for a friend\\'s projected cook-book, but as I forgot to furnish\\ndiagrams and perspectives, they had to be left out, of course.\\n\\nRECIPE FOR AN ASH-CAKE\\n\\nTake a lot of water and add to it a lot of coarse Indian-meal and about\\na quarter of a lot of salt. Mix well together, knead into the form of\\na \"pone,\" and let the pone stand awhile--not on its edge, but the other\\nway. Rake away a place among the embers, lay it there, and cover it an\\ninch deep with hot ashes. When it is done, remove it; blow off all the\\nashes but one layer; butter that one and eat.\\n\\nN.B.--No household should ever be without this talisman. It has been\\nnoticed that tramps never return for another ash-cake.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nRECIPE FOR NEW ENGLISH PIE\\n\\nTo make this excellent breakfast dish, proceed as follows: Take a\\nsufficiency of water and a sufficiency of flour, and construct a\\nbullet-proof dough. Work this into the form of a disk, with the edges\\nturned up some three-fourths of an inch. Toughen and kiln-dry in a\\ncouple days in a mild but unvarying temperature. Construct a cover for\\nthis redoubt in the same way and of the same material. Fill with stewed\\ndried apples; aggravate with cloves, lemon-peel, and slabs of citron;\\nadd two portions of New Orleans sugars, then solder on the lid and set\\nin a safe place till it petrifies. Serve cold at breakfast and invite\\nyour enemy.\\n\\n----------\\n\\nRECIPE FOR GERMAN COFFEE\\n\\nTake a barrel of water and bring it to a boil; rub a chicory berry\\nagainst a coffee berry, then convey the former into the water. Continue\\nthe boiling and evaporation until the intensity of the flavor and aroma\\nof the coffee and chicory has been diminished to a proper degree; then\\nset aside to cool. Now unharness the remains of a once cow from the\\nplow, insert them in a hydraulic press, and when you shall have acquired\\na teaspoon of that pale-blue juice which a German superstition regards\\nas milk, modify the malignity of its strength in a bucket of tepid water\\nand ring up the breakfast. Mix the beverage in a cold cup, partake\\nwith moderation, and keep a wet rag around your head to guard against\\nover-excitement.\\n\\nTO CARVE FOWLS IN THE GERMAN FASHION\\n\\nUse a club, and avoid the joints.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER L\\n\\n[Titian Bad and Titian Good]\\n\\nI wonder why some things are? For instance, Art is allowed as much\\nindecent license today as in earlier times--but the privileges of\\nLiterature in this respect have been sharply curtailed within the\\npast eighty or ninety years. Fielding and Smollett could portray the\\nbeastliness of their day in the beastliest language; we have plenty\\nof foul subjects to deal with in our day, but we are not allowed to\\napproach them very near, even with nice and guarded forms of speech.\\nBut not so with Art. The brush may still deal freely with any subject,\\nhowever revolting or indelicate. It makes a body ooze sarcasm at every\\npore, to go about Rome and Florence and see what this last generation\\nhas been doing with the statues. These works, which had stood in\\ninnocent nakedness for ages, are all fig-leaved now. Yes, every one of\\nthem. Nobody noticed their nakedness before, perhaps; nobody can help\\nnoticing it now, the fig-leaf makes it so conspicuous. But the comical\\nthing about it all, is, that the fig-leaf is confined to cold and pallid\\nmarble, which would be still cold and unsuggestive without this sham and\\nostentatious symbol of modesty, whereas warm-blood paintings which do\\nreally need it have in no case been furnished with it.\\n\\nAt the door of the Uffizzi, in Florence, one is confronted by statues\\nof a man and a woman, noseless, battered, black with accumulated\\ngrime--they hardly suggest human beings--yet these ridiculous creatures\\nhave been thoughtfully and conscientiously fig-leaved by this fastidious\\ngeneration. You enter, and proceed to that most-visited little gallery\\nthat exists in the world--the Tribune--and there, against the wall,\\nwithout obstructing rag or leaf, you may look your fill upon the\\nfoulest, the vilest, the obscenest picture the world possesses--Titian\\'s\\nVenus. It isn\\'t that she is naked and stretched out on a bed--no, it is\\nthe attitude of one of her arms and hand. If I ventured to describe\\nthat attitude, there would be a fine howl--but there the Venus lies, for\\nanybody to gloat over that wants to--and there she has a right to lie,\\nfor she is a work of art, and Art has its privileges. I saw young\\ngirls stealing furtive glances at her; I saw young men gaze long and\\nabsorbedly at her; I saw aged, infirm men hang upon her charms with a\\npathetic interest. How I should like to describe her--just to see what\\na holy indignation I could stir up in the world--just to hear the\\nunreflecting average man deliver himself about my grossness and\\ncoarseness, and all that. The world says that no worded description of\\na moving spectacle is a hundredth part as moving as the same spectacle\\nseen with one\\'s own eyes--yet the world is willing to let its son\\nand its daughter and itself look at Titian\\'s beast, but won\\'t stand\\na description of it in words. Which shows that the world is not as\\nconsistent as it might be.\\n\\nThere are pictures of nude women which suggest no impure thought--I\\nam well aware of that. I am not railing at such. What I am trying to\\nemphasize is the fact that Titian\\'s Venus is very far from being one of\\nthat sort. Without any question it was painted for a bagnio and it was\\nprobably refused because it was a trifle too strong. In truth, it is too\\nstrong for any place but a public Art Gallery. Titian has two Venuses in\\nthe Tribune; persons who have seen them will easily remember which one I\\nam referring to.\\n\\nIn every gallery in Europe there are hideous pictures of blood,\\ncarnage, oozing brains, putrefaction--pictures portraying intolerable\\nsuffering--pictures alive with every conceivable horror, wrought out in\\ndreadful detail--and similar pictures are being put on the canvas every\\nday and publicly exhibited--without a growl from anybody--for they\\nare innocent, they are inoffensive, being works of art. But suppose\\na literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate\\ndescription of one of these grisly things--the critics would skin him\\nalive. Well, let it go, it cannot be helped; Art retains her privileges,\\nLiterature has lost hers. Somebody else may cipher out the whys and the\\nwherefores and the consistencies of it--I haven\\'t got time.\\n\\nTitian\\'s Venus defiles and disgraces the Tribune, there is no softening\\nthat fact, but his \"Moses\" glorifies it. The simple truthfulness of\\nits noble work wins the heart and the applause of every visitor, be he\\nlearned or ignorant. After wearying one\\'s self with the acres of stuffy,\\nsappy, expressionless babies that populate the canvases of the Old\\nMasters of Italy, it is refreshing to stand before this peerless child\\nand feel that thrill which tells you you are at last in the presence of\\nthe real thing. This is a human child, this is genuine. You have seen\\nhim a thousand times--you have seen him just as he is here--and you\\nconfess, without reserve, that Titian _was_ a Master. The doll-faces of\\nother painted babes may mean one thing, they may mean another, but\\nwith the \"Moses\" the case is different. The most famous of all the\\nart-critics has said, \"There is no room for doubt, here--plainly this\\nchild is in trouble.\"\\n\\nI consider that the \"Moses\" has no equal among the works of the Old\\nMasters, except it be the divine Hair Trunk of Bassano. I feel sure that\\nif all the other Old Masters were lost and only these two preserved, the\\nworld would be the gainer by it.\\n\\nMy sole purpose in going to Florence was to see this immortal \"Moses,\"\\nand by good fortune I was just in time, for they were already preparing\\nto remove it to a more private and better-protected place because a\\nfashion of robbing the great galleries was prevailing in Europe at the\\ntime.\\n\\nI got a capable artist to copy the picture; Pannemaker, the engraver of\\nDor\\'s books, engraved it for me, and I have the pleasure of laying it\\nbefore the reader in this volume.\\n\\nWe took a turn to Rome and some other Italian cities--then to Munich,\\nand thence to Paris--partly for exercise, but mainly because these\\nthings were in our projected program, and it was only right that we\\nshould be faithful to it.\\n\\nFrom Paris I branched out and walked through Holland and Belgium,\\nprocuring an occasional lift by rail or canal when tired, and I had\\na tolerably good time of it \"by and large.\" I worked Spain and other\\nregions through agents to save time and shoe-leather.\\n\\nWe crossed to England, and then made the homeward passage in\\nthe Cunarder _Gallia_, a very fine ship. I was glad to get\\nhome--immeasurably glad; so glad, in fact, that it did not seem possible\\nthat anything could ever get me out of the country again. I had not\\nenjoyed a pleasure abroad which seemed to me to compare with the\\npleasure I felt in seeing New York harbor again. Europe has many\\nadvantages which we have not, but they do not compensate for a good many\\nstill more valuable ones which exist nowhere but in our own country.\\nThen we are such a homeless lot when we are over there! So are\\nEuropeans themselves, for that matter. They live in dark and chilly vast\\ntombs--costly enough, maybe, but without conveniences. To be condemned\\nto live as the average European family lives would make life a pretty\\nheavy burden to the average American family.\\n\\nOn the whole, I think that short visits to Europe are better for us than\\nlong ones. The former preserve us from becoming Europeanized; they keep\\nour pride of country intact, and at the same time they intensify our\\naffection for our country and our people; whereas long visits have the\\neffect of dulling those feelings--at least in the majority of cases. I\\nthink that one who mixes much with Americans long resident abroad must\\narrive at this conclusion.\\n\\nAPPENDIX\\n\\nNothing gives such weight and dignity to a book as an Appendix.\\nHERODOTUS\\n\\nAPPENDIX A.\\n\\nThe Portier\\n\\nOmar Khay\\'am, the poet-prophet of Persia, writing more than eight\\nhundred years ago, has said:\\n\\n\"In the four parts of the earth are many that are able to write learned\\nbooks, many that are able to lead armies, and many also that are able to\\ngovern kingdoms and empires; but few there be that can keep a hotel.\"\\n\\nA word about the European hotel _Portier_. He is a most admirable\\ninvention, a most valuable convenience. He always wears a conspicuous\\nuniform; he can always be found when he is wanted, for he sticks closely\\nto his post at the front door; he is as polite as a duke; he speaks\\nfrom four to ten languages; he is your surest help and refuge in time of\\ntrouble or perplexity. He is not the clerk, he is not the landlord; he\\nranks above the clerk, and represents the landlord, who is seldom seen.\\nInstead of going to the clerk for information, as we do at home, you\\ngo to the portier. It is the pride of our average hotel clerk to know\\nnothing whatever; it is the pride of the portier to know everything. You\\nask the portier at what hours the trains leave--he tells you instantly;\\nor you ask him who is the best physician in town; or what is the hack\\ntariff; or how many children the mayor has; or what days the galleries\\nare open, and whether a permit is required, and where you are to get it,\\nand what you must pay for it; or when the theaters open and close, what\\nthe plays are to be, and the price of seats; or what is the newest thing\\nin hats; or how the bills of mortality average; or \"who struck Billy\\nPatterson.\" It does not matter what you ask him: in nine cases out of\\nten he knows, and in the tenth case he will find out for you before you\\ncan turn around three times. There is nothing he will not put his hand\\nto. Suppose you tell him you wish to go from Hamburg to Peking by the\\nway of Jericho, and are ignorant of routes and prices--the next morning\\nhe will hand you a piece of paper with the whole thing worked out on it\\nto the last detail. Before you have been long on European soil, you find\\nyourself still _saying_ you are relying on Providence, but when you\\ncome to look closer you will see that in reality you are relying on the\\nportier. He discovers what is puzzling you, or what is troubling you,\\nor what your need is, before you can get the half of it out, and he\\npromptly says, \"Leave that to me.\" Consequently, you easily drift into\\nthe habit of leaving everything to him. There is a certain embarrassment\\nabout applying to the average American hotel clerk, a certain hesitancy,\\na sense of insecurity against rebuff; but you feel no embarrassment in\\nyour intercourse with the portier; he receives your propositions with an\\nenthusiasm which cheers, and plunges into their accomplishment with an\\nalacrity which almost inebriates. The more requirements you can pile\\nupon him, the better he likes it. Of course the result is that you cease\\nfrom doing anything for yourself. He calls a hack when you want one;\\nputs you into it; tells the driver whither to take you; receives you\\nlike a long-lost child when you return; sends you about your business,\\ndoes all the quarreling with the hackman himself, and pays him his money\\nout of his own pocket. He sends for your theater tickets, and pays for\\nthem; he sends for any possible article you can require, be it a doctor,\\nan elephant, or a postage stamp; and when you leave, at last, you will\\nfind a subordinate seated with the cab-driver who will put you in your\\nrailway compartment, buy your tickets, have your baggage weighed, bring\\nyou the printed tags, and tell you everything is in your bill and paid\\nfor. At home you get such elaborate, excellent, and willing service as\\nthis only in the best hotels of our large cities; but in Europe you get\\nit in the mere back country-towns just as well.\\n\\nWhat is the secret of the portier\\'s devotion? It is very simple: he gets\\n_fees, and no salary_. His fee is pretty closely regulated, too. If you\\nstay a week, you give him five marks--a dollar and a quarter, or about\\neighteen cents a day. If you stay a month, you reduce this average\\nsomewhat. If you stay two or three months or longer, you cut it down\\nhalf, or even more than half. If you stay only one day, you give the\\nportier a mark.\\n\\nThe head waiter\\'s fee is a shade less than the portier\\'s; the Boots, who\\nnot only blacks your boots and brushes your clothes, but is usually the\\nporter and handles your baggage, gets a somewhat smaller fee than the\\nhead waiter; the chambermaid\\'s fee ranks below that of the Boots. You\\nfee only these four, and no one else. A German gentleman told me that\\nwhen he remained a week in a hotel, he gave the portier five marks, the\\nhead waiter four, the Boots three, and the chambermaid two; and if he\\nstayed three months he divided ninety marks among them, in about the\\nabove proportions. Ninety marks make $22.50.\\n\\nNone of these fees are ever paid until you leave the hotel, though it\\nbe a year--except one of these four servants should go away in the mean\\ntime; in that case he will be sure to come and bid you good-by and\\ngive you the opportunity to pay him what is fairly coming to him. It\\nis considered very bad policy to fee a servant while you are still to\\nremain longer in the hotel, because if you gave him too little he might\\nneglect you afterward, and if you gave him too much he might neglect\\nsomebody else to attend to you. It is considered best to keep his\\nexpectations \"on a string\" until your stay is concluded.\\n\\nI do not know whether hotel servants in New York get any wages or not,\\nbut I do know that in some of the hotels there the feeing system in\\nvogue is a heavy burden. The waiter expects a quarter at breakfast--and\\ngets it. You have a different waiter at luncheon, and so he gets a\\nquarter. Your waiter at dinner is another stranger--consequently he gets\\na quarter. The boy who carries your satchel to your room and lights your\\ngas fumbles around and hangs around significantly, and you fee him to\\nget rid of him. Now you may ring for ice-water; and ten minutes later\\nfor a lemonade; and ten minutes afterward, for a cigar; and by and by\\nfor a newspaper--and what is the result? Why, a new boy has appeared\\nevery time and fooled and fumbled around until you have paid him\\nsomething. Suppose you boldly put your foot down, and say it is the\\nhotel\\'s business to pay its servants? You will have to ring your bell\\nten or fifteen times before you get a servant there; and when he goes\\noff to fill your order you will grow old and infirm before you see him\\nagain. You may struggle nobly for twenty-four hours, maybe, if you are\\nan adamantine sort of person, but in the mean time you will have been\\nso wretchedly served, and so insolently, that you will haul down your\\ncolors, and go to impoverishing yourself with fees.\\n\\nIt seems to me that it would be a happy idea to import the European\\nfeeing system into America. I believe it would result in getting even\\nthe bells of the Philadelphia hotels answered, and cheerful service\\nrendered.\\n\\nThe greatest American hotels keep a number of clerks and a cashier, and\\npay them salaries which mount up to a considerable total in the course\\nof a year. The great continental hotels keep a cashier on a trifling\\nsalary, and a portier _who pays the hotel a salary_. By the latter\\nsystem both the hotel and the public save money and are better served\\nthan by our system. One of our consuls told me that a portier of a great\\nBerlin hotel paid five thousand dollars a year for his position, and yet\\ncleared six thousand dollars for himself. The position of portier in the\\nchief hotels of Saratoga, Long Branch, New York, and similar centers of\\nresort, would be one which the holder could afford to pay even more than\\nfive thousand dollars for, perhaps.\\n\\nWhen we borrowed the feeing fashion from Europe a dozen years ago, the\\nsalary system ought to have been discontinued, of course. We might make\\nthis correction now, I should think. And we might add the portier, too.\\nSince I first began to study the portier, I have had opportunities to\\nobserve him in the chief cities of Germany, Switzerland, and Italy;\\nand the more I have seen of him the more I have wished that he might be\\nadopted in America, and become there, as he is in Europe, the stranger\\'s\\nguardian angel.\\n\\nYes, what was true eight hundred years ago, is just as true today: \"Few\\nthere be that can keep a hotel.\" Perhaps it is because the landlords and\\ntheir subordinates have in too many cases taken up their trade without\\nfirst learning it. In Europe the trade of hotel-keeper is taught. The\\napprentice begins at the bottom of the ladder and masters the several\\ngrades one after the other. Just as in our country printing-offices the\\napprentice first learns how to sweep out and bring water; then learns\\nto \"roll\"; then to sort \"pi\"; then to set type; and finally rounds\\nand completes his education with job-work and press-work; so the\\nlandlord-apprentice serves as call-boy; then as under-waiter; then as\\na parlor waiter; then as head waiter, in which position he often has to\\nmake out all the bills; then as clerk or cashier; then as portier. His\\ntrade is learned now, and by and by he will assume the style and dignity\\nof landlord, and be found conducting a hotel of his own.\\n\\nNow in Europe, the same as in America, when a man has kept a hotel\\nso thoroughly well during a number of years as to give it a great\\nreputation, he has his reward. He can live prosperously on that\\nreputation. He can let his hotel run down to the last degree of\\nshabbiness and yet have it full of people all the time. For instance,\\nthere is the Hotel de Ville, in Milan. It swarms with mice and fleas,\\nand if the rest of the world were destroyed it could furnish dirt enough\\nto start another one with. The food would create an insurrection in a\\npoorhouse; and yet if you go outside to get your meals that hotel makes\\nup its loss by overcharging you on all sorts of trifles--and without\\nmaking any denials or excuses about it, either. But the Hotel de Ville\\'s\\nold excellent reputation still keeps its dreary rooms crowded with\\ntravelers who would be elsewhere if they had only some wise friend to\\nwarn them.\\n\\nAPPENDIX B.\\n\\nHeidelberg Castle\\n\\nHeidelberg Castle must have been very beautiful before the French\\nbattered and bruised and scorched it two hundred years ago. The stone\\nis brown, with a pinkish tint, and does not seem to stain easily. The\\ndainty and elaborate ornamentation upon its two chief fronts is as\\ndelicately carved as if it had been intended for the interior of a\\ndrawing-room rather than for the outside of a house. Many fruit and\\nflower clusters, human heads and grim projecting lions\\' heads are still\\nas perfect in every detail as if they were new. But the statues which\\nare ranked between the windows have suffered. These are life-size\\nstatues of old-time emperors, electors, and similar grandees, clad in\\nmail and bearing ponderous swords. Some have lost an arm, some a head,\\nand one poor fellow is chopped off at the middle. There is a saying that\\nif a stranger will pass over the drawbridge and walk across the court to\\nthe castle front without saying anything, he can make a wish and it will\\nbe fulfilled. But they say that the truth of this thing has never had\\na chance to be proved, for the reason that before any stranger can walk\\nfrom the drawbridge to the appointed place, the beauty of the palace\\nfront will extort an exclamation of delight from him.\\n\\nA ruin must be rightly situated, to be effective. This one could not\\nhave been better placed. It stands upon a commanding elevation, it is\\nburied in green woods, there is no level ground about it, but, on the\\ncontrary, there are wooded terraces upon terraces, and one looks down\\nthrough shining leaves into profound chasms and abysses where twilight\\nreigns and the sun cannot intrude. Nature knows how to garnish a ruin to\\nget the best effect. One of these old towers is split down the middle,\\nand one half has tumbled aside. It tumbled in such a way as to establish\\nitself in a picturesque attitude. Then all it lacked was a fitting\\ndrapery, and Nature has furnished that; she has robed the rugged mass in\\nflowers and verdure, and made it a charm to the eye. The standing half\\nexposes its arched and cavernous rooms to you, like open, toothless\\nmouths; there, too, the vines and flowers have done their work of grace.\\nThe rear portion of the tower has not been neglected, either, but is\\nclothed with a clinging garment of polished ivy which hides the wounds\\nand stains of time. Even the top is not left bare, but is crowned with a\\nflourishing group of trees and shrubs. Misfortune has done for this old\\ntower what it has done for the human character sometimes--improved it.\\n\\nA gentleman remarked, one day, that it might have been fine to live in\\nthe castle in the day of its prime, but that we had one advantage which\\nits vanished inhabitants lacked--the advantage of having a charming ruin\\nto visit and muse over. But that was a hasty idea. Those people had the\\nadvantage of _us_. They had the fine castle to live in, and they\\ncould cross the Rhine valley and muse over the stately ruin of Trifels\\nbesides. The Trifels people, in their day, five hundred years ago, could\\ngo and muse over majestic ruins that have vanished, now, to the last\\nstone. There have always been ruins, no doubt; and there have always\\nbeen pensive people to sigh over them, and asses to scratch upon them\\ntheir names and the important date of their visit. Within a hundred\\nyears after Adam left Eden, the guide probably gave the usual general\\nflourish with his hand and said: \"Place where the animals were named,\\nladies and gentlemen; place where the tree of the forbidden fruit stood;\\nexact spot where Adam and Eve first met; and here, ladies and gentlemen,\\nadorned and hallowed by the names and addresses of three generations of\\ntourists, we have the crumbling remains of Cain\\'s altar--fine old ruin!\"\\nThen, no doubt, he taxed them a shekel apiece and let them go.\\n\\nAn illumination of Heidelberg Castle is one of the sights of Europe.\\nThe Castle\\'s picturesque shape; its commanding situation, midway up the\\nsteep and wooded mountainside; its vast size--these features combine to\\nmake an illumination a most effective spectacle. It is necessarily an\\nexpensive show, and consequently rather infrequent. Therefore whenever\\none of these exhibitions is to take place, the news goes about in the\\npapers and Heidelberg is sure to be full of people on that night. I and\\nmy agent had one of these opportunities, and improved it.\\n\\nAbout half past seven on the appointed evening we crossed the lower\\nbridge, with some American students, in a pouring rain, and started up\\nthe road which borders the Neunheim side of the river. This roadway was\\ndensely packed with carriages and foot-passengers; the former of all\\nages, and the latter of all ages and both sexes. This black and solid\\nmass was struggling painfully onward, through the slop, the darkness,\\nand the deluge. We waded along for three-quarters of a mile, and finally\\ntook up a position in an unsheltered beer-garden directly opposite\\nthe Castle. We could not _see_ the Castle--or anything else, for that\\nmatter--but we could dimly discern the outlines of the mountain over the\\nway, through the pervading blackness, and knew whereabouts the Castle\\nwas located. We stood on one of the hundred benches in the garden, under\\nour umbrellas; the other ninety-nine were occupied by standing men and\\nwomen, and they also had umbrellas. All the region round about, and up\\nand down the river-road, was a dense wilderness of humanity hidden\\nunder an unbroken pavement of carriage tops and umbrellas. Thus we stood\\nduring two drenching hours. No rain fell on my head, but the converging\\nwhalebone points of a dozen neighboring umbrellas poured little cooling\\nsteams of water down my neck, and sometimes into my ears, and thus kept\\nme from getting hot and impatient. I had the rheumatism, too, and\\nhad heard that this was good for it. Afterward, however, I was led to\\nbelieve that the water treatment is _not_ good for rheumatism. There\\nwere even little girls in that dreadful place. A man held one in\\nhis arms, just in front of me, for as much as an hour, with\\numbrella-drippings soaking into her clothing all the time.\\n\\nIn the circumstances, two hours was a good while for us to have to wait,\\nbut when the illumination did at last come, we felt repaid. It came\\nunexpectedly, of course--things always do, that have been long looked\\nand longed for. With a perfectly breath-taking suddenness several mast\\nsheaves of varicolored rockets were vomited skyward out of the black\\nthroats of the Castle towers, accompanied by a thundering crash of\\nsound, and instantly every detail of the prodigious ruin stood revealed\\nagainst the mountainside and glowing with an almost intolerable splendor\\nof fire and color. For some little time the whole building was a\\nblinding crimson mass, the towers continued to spout thick columns of\\nrockets aloft, and overhead the sky was radiant with arrowy bolts which\\nclove their way to the zenith, paused, curved gracefully downward, then\\nburst into brilliant fountain-sprays of richly colored sparks. The red\\nfires died slowly down, within the Castle, and presently the shell grew\\nnearly black outside; the angry glare that shone out through the broken\\narches and innumerable sashless windows, now, reproduced the aspect\\nwhich the Castle must have borne in the old time when the French\\nspoilers saw the monster bonfire which they had made there fading and\\nspoiling toward extinction.\\n\\nWhile we still gazed and enjoyed, the ruin was suddenly enveloped in\\nrolling and rumbling volumes of vaporous green fire; then in dazzling\\npurple ones; then a mixture of many colors followed, then drowned the\\ngreat fabric in its blended splendors. Meantime the nearest bridge had\\nbeen illuminated, and from several rafts anchored in the river, meteor\\nshowers of rockets, Roman candles, bombs, serpents, and Catharine wheels\\nwere being discharged in wasteful profusion into the sky--a marvelous\\nsight indeed to a person as little used to such spectacles as I was. For\\na while the whole region about us seemed as bright as day, and yet the\\nrain was falling in torrents all the time. The evening\\'s entertainment\\npresently closed, and we joined the innumerable caravan of half-drowned\\nstrangers, and waded home again.\\n\\nThe Castle grounds are very ample and very beautiful; and as they joined\\nthe Hotel grounds, with no fences to climb, but only some nobly shaded\\nstone stairways to descend, we spent a part of nearly every day in\\nidling through their smooth walks and leafy groves. There was an\\nattractive spot among the trees where were a great many wooden tables\\nand benches; and there one could sit in the shade and pretend to sip at\\nhis foamy beaker of beer while he inspected the crowd. I say pretend,\\nbecause I only pretended to sip, without really sipping. That is the\\npolite way; but when you are ready to go, you empty the beaker at a\\ndraught. There was a brass band, and it furnished excellent music every\\nafternoon. Sometimes so many people came that every seat was occupied,\\nevery table filled. And never a rough in the assemblage--all nicely\\ndressed fathers and mothers, young gentlemen and ladies and children;\\nand plenty of university students and glittering officers; with here and\\nthere a gray professor, or a peaceful old lady with her knitting; and\\nalways a sprinkling of gawky foreigners. Everybody had his glass of\\nbeer before him, or his cup of coffee, or his bottle of wine, or his\\nhot cutlet and potatoes; young ladies chatted, or fanned themselves, or\\nwrought at their crocheting or embroidering; the students fed sugar to\\ntheir dogs, or discussed duels, or illustrated new fencing tricks\\nwith their little canes; and everywhere was comfort and enjoyment, and\\neverywhere peace and good-will to men. The trees were jubilant with\\nbirds, and the paths with rollicking children. One could have a seat in\\nthat place and plenty of music, any afternoon, for about eight cents, or\\na family ticket for the season for two dollars.\\n\\nFor a change, when you wanted one, you could stroll to the Castle, and\\nburrow among its dungeons, or climb about its ruined towers, or visit\\nits interior shows--the great Heidelberg Tun, for instance. Everybody\\nhas heard of the great Heidelberg Tun, and most people have seen it, no\\ndoubt. It is a wine-cask as big as a cottage, and some traditions say\\nit holds eighteen thousand bottles, and other traditions say it holds\\neighteen hundred million barrels. I think it likely that one of these\\nstatements is a mistake, and the other is a lie. However, the mere\\nmatter of capacity is a thing of no sort of consequence, since the cask\\nis empty, and indeed has always been empty, history says. An empty cask\\nthe size of a cathedral could excite but little emotion in me.\\n\\nI do not see any wisdom in building a monster cask to hoard up emptiness\\nin, when you can get a better quality, outside, any day, free of\\nexpense. What could this cask have been built for? The more one studies\\nover that, the more uncertain and unhappy he becomes. Some historians\\nsay that thirty couples, some say thirty thousand couples, can dance on\\nthe head of this cask at the same time. Even this does not seem to me\\nto account for the building of it. It does not even throw light on it. A\\nprofound and scholarly Englishman--a specialist--who had made the great\\nHeidelberg Tun his sole study for fifteen years, told me he had at last\\nsatisfied himself that the ancients built it to make German cream in.\\nHe said that the average German cow yielded from one to two and half\\nteaspoons of milk, when she was not worked in the plow or the hay-wagon\\nmore than eighteen or nineteen hours a day. This milk was very sweet and\\ngood, and a beautiful transparent bluish tint; but in order to get cream\\nfrom it in the most economical way, a peculiar process was necessary.\\nNow he believed that the habit of the ancients was to collect several\\nmilkings in a teacup, pour it into the Great Tun, fill up with water,\\nand then skim off the cream from time to time as the needs of the German\\nEmpire demanded.\\n\\nThis began to look reasonable. It certainly began to account for the\\nGerman cream which I had encountered and marveled over in so many hotels\\nand restaurants. But a thought struck me--\\n\\n\"Why did not each ancient dairyman take his own teacup of milk and his\\nown cask of water, and mix them, without making a government matter of\\nit?\\'\\n\\n\"Where could he get a cask large enough to contain the right proportion\\nof water?\"\\n\\nVery true. It was plain that the Englishman had studied the matter from\\nall sides. Still I thought I might catch him on one point; so I asked\\nhim why the modern empire did not make the nation\\'s cream in the\\nHeidelberg Tun, instead of leaving it to rot away unused. But he\\nanswered as one prepared--\\n\\n\"A patient and diligent examination of the modern German cream had\\nsatisfied me that they do not use the Great Tun now, because they have\\ngot a _bigger_ one hid away somewhere. Either that is the case or they\\nempty the spring milkings into the mountain torrents and then skim the\\nRhine all summer.\"\\n\\nThere is a museum of antiquities in the Castle, and among its most\\ntreasured relics are ancient manuscripts connected with German history.\\nThere are hundreds of these, and their dates stretch back through many\\ncenturies. One of them is a decree signed and sealed by the hand of a\\nsuccessor of Charlemagne, in the year 896. A signature made by a hand\\nwhich vanished out of this life near a thousand years ago, is a more\\nimpressive thing than even a ruined castle. Luther\\'s wedding-ring was\\nshown me; also a fork belonging to a time anterior to our era, and an\\nearly bootjack. And there was a plaster cast of the head of a man who\\nwas assassinated about sixty years ago. The stab-wounds in the face\\nwere duplicated with unpleasant fidelity. One or two real hairs still\\nremained sticking in the eyebrows of the cast. That trifle seemed to\\nalmost change the counterfeit into a corpse.\\n\\nThere are many aged portraits--some valuable, some worthless; some of\\ngreat interest, some of none at all. I bought a couple--one a gorgeous\\nduke of the olden time, and the other a comely blue-eyed damsel,\\na princess, maybe. I bought them to start a portrait-gallery of my\\nancestors with. I paid a dollar and a half for the duke and a half for\\nthe princess. One can lay in ancestors at even cheaper rates than these,\\nin Europe, if he will mouse among old picture shops and look out for\\nchances.\\n\\nAPPENDIX C.\\n\\nThe College Prison\\n\\nIt seems that the student may break a good many of the public laws\\nwithout having to answer to the public authorities. His case must come\\nbefore the University for trial and punishment. If a policeman catches\\nhim in an unlawful act and proceeds to arrest him, the offender\\nproclaims that he is a student, and perhaps shows his matriculation\\ncard, whereupon the officer asks for his address, then goes his way, and\\nreports the matter at headquarters. If the offense is one over which the\\ncity has no jurisdiction, the authorities report the case officially\\nto the University, and give themselves no further concern about it.\\nThe University court send for the student, listen to the evidence, and\\npronounce judgment. The punishment usually inflicted is imprisonment\\nin the University prison. As I understand it, a student\\'s case is\\noften tried without his being present at all. Then something like\\nthis happens: A constable in the service of the University visits the\\nlodgings of the said student, knocks, is invited to come in, does so,\\nand says politely--\\n\\n\"If you please, I am here to conduct you to prison.\"\\n\\n\"Ah,\" says the student, \"I was not expecting it. What have I been\\ndoing?\"\\n\\n\"Two weeks ago the public peace had the honor to be disturbed by you.\"\\n\\n\"It is true; I had forgotten it. Very well: I have been complained of,\\ntried, and found guilty--is that it?\"\\n\\n\"Exactly. You are sentenced to two days\\' solitary confinement in the\\nCollege prison, and I am sent to fetch you.\"\\n\\nSTUDENT. \"O, I can\\'t go today.\"\\n\\nOFFICER. \"If you please--why?\"\\n\\nSTUDENT. \"Because I\\'ve got an engagement.\"\\n\\nOFFICER. \"Tomorrow, then, perhaps?\"\\n\\nSTUDENT. \"No, I am going to the opera, tomorrow.\"\\n\\nOFFICER. \"Could you come Friday?\"\\n\\nSTUDENT. (Reflectively.) \"Let me see--Friday--Friday. I don\\'t seem to\\nhave anything on hand Friday.\"\\n\\nOFFICER. \"Then, if you please, I will expect you on Friday.\"\\n\\nSTUDENT. \"All right, I\\'ll come around Friday.\"\\n\\nOFFICER. \"Thank you. Good day, sir.\"\\n\\nSTUDENT. \"Good day.\"\\n\\nSo on Friday the student goes to the prison of his own accord, and is\\nadmitted.\\n\\nIt is questionable if the world\\'s criminal history can show a custom\\nmore odd than this. Nobody knows, now, how it originated. There have\\nalways been many noblemen among the students, and it is presumed that\\nall students are gentlemen; in the old times it was usual to mar the\\nconvenience of such folk as little as possible; perhaps this indulgent\\ncustom owes its origin to this.\\n\\nOne day I was listening to some conversation upon this subject when an\\nAmerican student said that for some time he had been under sentence\\nfor a slight breach of the peace and had promised the constable that he\\nwould presently find an unoccupied day and betake himself to prison. I\\nasked the young gentleman to do me the kindness to go to jail as soon\\nas he conveniently could, so that I might try to get in there and visit\\nhim, and see what college captivity was like. He said he would appoint\\nthe very first day he could spare.\\n\\nHis confinement was to endure twenty-four hours. He shortly chose\\nhis day, and sent me word. I started immediately. When I reached the\\nUniversity Place, I saw two gentlemen talking together, and, as they\\nhad portfolios under their arms, I judged they were tutors or elderly\\nstudents; so I asked them in English to show me the college jail. I\\nhad learned to take it for granted that anybody in Germany who knows\\nanything, knows English, so I had stopped afflicting people with my\\nGerman. These gentlemen seemed a trifle amused--and a trifle confused,\\ntoo--but one of them said he would walk around the corner with me and\\nshow me the place. He asked me why I wanted to get in there, and I said\\nto see a friend--and for curiosity. He doubted if I would be admitted,\\nbut volunteered to put in a word or two for me with the custodian.\\n\\nHe rang the bell, a door opened, and we stepped into a paved way and\\nthen up into a small living-room, where we were received by a hearty\\nand good-natured German woman of fifty. She threw up her hands with a\\nsurprised \"_ach Gott, Herr Professor!_\" and exhibited a mighty deference\\nfor my new acquaintance. By the sparkle in her eye I judged she was a\\ngood deal amused, too. The \"Herr Professor\" talked to her in German, and\\nI understood enough of it to know that he was bringing very plausible\\nreasons to bear for admitting me. They were successful. So the Herr\\nProfessor received my earnest thanks and departed. The old dame got her\\nkeys, took me up two or three flights of stairs, unlocked a door, and\\nwe stood in the presence of the criminal. Then she went into a jolly and\\neager description of all that had occurred downstairs, and what the Herr\\nProfessor had said, and so forth and so on. Plainly, she regarded it as\\nquite a superior joke that I had waylaid a Professor and employed him\\nin so odd a service. But I wouldn\\'t have done it if I had known he was a\\nProfessor; therefore my conscience was not disturbed.\\n\\nNow the dame left us to ourselves. The cell was not a roomy one; still\\nit was a little larger than an ordinary prison cell. It had a window\\nof good size, iron-grated; a small stove; two wooden chairs; two oaken\\ntables, very old and most elaborately carved with names, mottoes, faces,\\narmorial bearings, etc.--the work of several generations of imprisoned\\nstudents; and a narrow wooden bedstead with a villainous straw mattress,\\nbut no sheets, pillows, blankets, or coverlets--for these the student\\nmust furnish at his own cost if he wants them. There was no carpet, of\\ncourse.\\n\\nThe ceiling was completely covered with names, dates, and monograms,\\ndone with candle-smoke. The walls were thickly covered with pictures and\\nportraits (in profile), some done with ink, some with soot, some with a\\npencil, and some with red, blue, and green chalks; and whenever an inch\\nor two of space had remained between the pictures, the captives had\\nwritten plaintive verses, or names and dates. I do not think I was ever\\nin a more elaborately frescoed apartment.\\n\\nAgainst the wall hung a placard containing the prison laws. I made a\\nnote of one or two of these. For instance: The prisoner must pay, for\\nthe \"privilege\" of entering, a sum equivalent to 20 cents of our money;\\nfor the privilege of leaving, when his term had expired, 20 cents; for\\nevery day spent in the prison, 12 cents; for fire and light, 12 cents a\\nday. The jailer furnishes coffee, mornings, for a small sum; dinners and\\nsuppers may be ordered from outside if the prisoner chooses--and he is\\nallowed to pay for them, too.\\n\\nHere and there, on the walls, appeared the names of American students,\\nand in one place the American arms and motto were displayed in colored\\nchalks.\\n\\nWith the help of my friend I translated many of the inscriptions.\\n\\nSome of them were cheerful, others the reverse. I will give the reader a\\nfew specimens:\\n\\n\"In my tenth semester (my best one), I am cast here through the\\ncomplaints of others. Let those who follow me take warning.\"\\n\\n\"_III Tage Ohne Grund Angeblich Aus Neugierde_.\" Which is to say, he had\\na curiosity to know what prison life was like; so he made a breach in\\nsome law and got three days for it. It is more than likely that he never\\nhad the same curiosity again.\\n\\n(_Translation._) \"E. Glinicke, four days for being too eager a spectator\\nof a row.\"\\n\\n\"F. Graf Bismarck--27-29, II, \\'74.\" Which means that Count Bismarck, son\\nof the great statesman, was a prisoner two days in 1874.\\n\\n(_Translation_.) \"R. Diergandt--for Love--4 days.\" Many people in this\\nworld have caught it heavier than for the same indiscretion.\\n\\nThis one is terse. I translate:\\n\\n\"Four weeks for _misinterpreted gallantry_.\" I wish the sufferer had\\nexplained a little more fully. A four-week term is a rather serious\\nmatter.\\n\\nThere were many uncomplimentary references, on the walls, to a certain\\nunpopular dignitary. One sufferer had got three days for not saluting\\nhim. Another had \"here two days slept and three nights lain awake,\"\\non account of this same \"Dr. K.\" In one place was a picture of Dr. K.\\nhanging on a gallows.\\n\\nHere and there, lonesome prisoners had eased the heavy time by altering\\nthe records left by predecessors. Leaving the name standing, and the\\ndate and length of the captivity, they had erased the description of the\\nmisdemeanor, and written in its place, in staring capitals, \"FOR THEFT!\"\\nor \"FOR MURDER!\" or some other gaudy crime. In one place, all by itself,\\nstood this blood-curdling word:\\n\\n\"Rache!\" [1]\\n\\n1. \"Revenge!\"\\n\\nThere was no name signed, and no date. It was an inscription well\\ncalculated to pique curiosity. One would greatly like to know the nature\\nof the wrong that had been done, and what sort of vengeance was wanted,\\nand whether the prisoner ever achieved it or not. But there was no way\\nof finding out these things.\\n\\nOccasionally, a name was followed simply by the remark, \"II days, for\\ndisturbing the peace,\" and without comment upon the justice or injustice\\nof the sentence.\\n\\nIn one place was a hilarious picture of a student of the green cap\\ncorps with a bottle of champagne in each hand; and below was the legend:\\n\"These make an evil fate endurable.\"\\n\\nThere were two prison cells, and neither had space left on walls or\\nceiling for another name or portrait or picture. The inside surfaces of\\nthe two doors were completely covered with _Cartes De Visite_ of former\\nprisoners, ingeniously let into the wood and protected from dirt and\\ninjury by glass.\\n\\nI very much wanted one of the sorry old tables which the prisoners had\\nspent so many years in ornamenting with their pocket-knives, but red\\ntape was in the way. The custodian could not sell one without an order\\nfrom a superior; and that superior would have to get it from _his_\\nsuperior; and this one would have to get it from a higher one--and so on\\nup and up until the faculty should sit on the matter and deliver final\\njudgment. The system was right, and nobody could find fault with it; but\\nit did not seem justifiable to bother so many people, so I proceeded no\\nfurther. It might have cost me more than I could afford, anyway; for\\none of those prison tables, which was at the time in a private museum\\nin Heidelberg, was afterward sold at auction for two hundred and fifty\\ndollars. It was not worth more than a dollar, or possibly a dollar and\\nhalf, before the captive students began their work on it. Persons who\\nsaw it at the auction said it was so curiously and wonderfully carved\\nthat it was worth the money that was paid for it.\\n\\nAmong them many who have tasted the college prison\\'s dreary hospitality\\nwas a lively young fellow from one of the Southern states of America,\\nwhose first year\\'s experience of German university life was rather\\npeculiar. The day he arrived in Heidelberg he enrolled his name on the\\ncollege books, and was so elated with the fact that his dearest hope\\nhad found fruition and he was actually a student of the old and renowned\\nuniversity, that he set to work that very night to celebrate the event\\nby a grand lark in company with some other students. In the course of\\nhis lark he managed to make a wide breach in one of the university\\'s\\nmost stringent laws. Sequel: before noon, next day, he was in the\\ncollege prison--booked for three months. The twelve long weeks dragged\\nslowly by, and the day of deliverance came at last. A great crowd of\\nsympathizing fellow-students received him with a rousing demonstration\\nas he came forth, and of course there was another grand lark--in the\\ncourse of which he managed to make a wide breach of the _city\\'s_ most\\nstringent laws. Sequel: before noon, next day, he was safe in the city\\nlockup--booked for three months. This second tedious captivity drew to\\nan end in the course of time, and again a great crowd of sympathizing\\nfellow students gave him a rousing reception as he came forth; but\\nhis delight in his freedom was so boundless that he could not proceed\\nsoberly and calmly, but must go hopping and skipping and jumping down\\nthe sleety street from sheer excess of joy. Sequel: he slipped and broke\\nhis leg, and actually lay in the hospital during the next three months!\\n\\nWhen he at last became a free man again, he said he believed he would\\nhunt up a brisker seat of learning; the Heidelberg lectures might\\nbe good, but the opportunities of attending them were too rare, the\\neducational process too slow; he said he had come to Europe with the\\nidea that the acquirement of an education was only a matter of time,\\nbut if he had averaged the Heidelberg system correctly, it was rather a\\nmatter of eternity.\\n\\nAPPENDIX D.\\n\\nThe Awful German Language\\n\\nA little learning makes the whole world kin. --Proverbs xxxii, 7.\\n\\nI went often to look at the collection of curiosities in Heidelberg\\nCastle, and one day I surprised the keeper of it with my German. I spoke\\nentirely in that language. He was greatly interested; and after I had\\ntalked a while he said my German was very rare, possibly a \"unique\"; and\\nwanted to add it to his museum.\\n\\nIf he had known what it had cost me to acquire my art, he would also\\nhave known that it would break any collector to buy it. Harris and I had\\nbeen hard at work on our German during several weeks at that time, and\\nalthough we had made good progress, it had been accomplished under great\\ndifficulty and annoyance, for three of our teachers had died in the mean\\ntime. A person who has not studied German can form no idea of what a\\nperplexing language it is.\\n\\nSurely there is not another language that is so slipshod and systemless,\\nand so slippery and elusive to the grasp. One is washed about in it,\\nhither and thither, in the most helpless way; and when at last he thinks\\nhe has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid\\nthe general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech, he turns over\\nthe page and reads, \"Let the pupil make careful note of the following\\n_Exceptions_.\" He runs his eye down and finds that there are more\\nexceptions to the rule than instances of it. So overboard he goes again,\\nto hunt for another Ararat and find another quicksand. Such has been,\\nand continues to be, my experience. Every time I think I have got one\\nof these four confusing \"cases\" where I am master of it, a seemingly\\ninsignificant preposition intrudes itself into my sentence, clothed with\\nan awful and unsuspected power, and crumbles the ground from under\\nme. For instance, my book inquires after a certain bird--(it is always\\ninquiring after things which are of no sort of consequence to anybody):\\n\"Where is the bird?\" Now the answer to this question--according to the\\nbook--is that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of\\nthe rain. Of course no bird would do that, but then you must stick to\\nthe book. Very well, I begin to cipher out the German for that answer. I\\nbegin at the wrong end, necessarily, for that is the German idea. I say\\nto myself, \"_regen_ (rain) is masculine--or maybe it is feminine--or\\npossibly neuter--it is too much trouble to look now. Therefore, it is\\neither _der_ (the) Regen, or _die_ (the) Regen, or _das_ (the) Regen,\\naccording to which gender it may turn out to be when I look. In the\\ninterest of science, I will cipher it out on the hypothesis that it is\\nmasculine. Very well--then _the_ rain is _der_ Regen, if it is simply\\nin the quiescent state of being _mentioned_, without enlargement or\\ndiscussion--Nominative case; but if this rain is lying around, in a kind\\nof a general way on the ground, it is then definitely located, it\\nis _doing something_--that is, _resting_ (which is one of the German\\ngrammar\\'s ideas of doing something), and this throws the rain into\\nthe Dative case, and makes it _dem_ Regen. However, this rain is not\\nresting, but is doing something _actively_,--it is falling--to interfere\\nwith the bird, likely--and this indicates _movement_, which has the\\neffect of sliding it into the Accusative case and changing _dem_ Regen\\ninto _den_ Regen.\" Having completed the grammatical horoscope of this\\nmatter, I answer up confidently and state in German that the bird is\\nstaying in the blacksmith shop \"wegen (on account of) _den_ Regen.\" Then\\nthe teacher lets me softly down with the remark that whenever the word\\n\"wegen\" drops into a sentence, it _always_ throws that subject into the\\n_genitive_ case, regardless of consequences--and therefore this bird\\nstayed in the blacksmith shop \"wegen _des_ Regens.\"\\n\\nN.B.--I was informed, later, by a higher authority, that there was an\\n\"exception\" which permits one to say \"wegen _den_ Regen\" in certain\\npeculiar and complex circumstances, but that this exception is not\\nextended to anything _but_ rain.\\n\\nThere are ten parts of speech, and they are all troublesome. An average\\nsentence, in a German newspaper, is a sublime and impressive curiosity;\\nit occupies a quarter of a column; it contains all the ten parts of\\nspeech--not in regular order, but mixed; it is built mainly of compound\\nwords constructed by the writer on the spot, and not to be found in\\nany dictionary--six or seven words compacted into one, without joint\\nor seam--that is, without hyphens; it treats of fourteen or fifteen\\ndifferent subjects, each enclosed in a parenthesis of its own, with here\\nand there extra parentheses, making pens within pens: finally, all the\\nparentheses and reparentheses are massed together between a couple\\nof king-parentheses, one of which is placed in the first line of the\\nmajestic sentence and the other in the middle of the last line of\\nit--_after which comes the verb_, and you find out for the first time\\nwhat the man has been talking about; and after the verb--merely by way\\nof ornament, as far as I can make out--the writer shovels in \"_haben\\nsind gewesen gehabt haven geworden sein_,\" or words to that effect, and\\nthe monument is finished. I suppose that this closing hurrah is in the\\nnature of the flourish to a man\\'s signature--not necessary, but pretty.\\nGerman books are easy enough to read when you hold them before\\nthe looking-glass or stand on your head--so as to reverse the\\nconstruction--but I think that to learn to read and understand a German\\nnewspaper is a thing which must always remain an impossibility to a\\nforeigner.\\n\\nYet even the German books are not entirely free from attacks of the\\nParenthesis distemper--though they are usually so mild as to cover only\\na few lines, and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it\\ncarries some meaning to your mind because you are able to remember a\\ngood deal of what has gone before. Now here is a sentence from a popular\\nand excellent German novel--with a slight parenthesis in it. I will make\\na perfectly literal translation, and throw in the parenthesis-marks and\\nsome hyphens for the assistance of the reader--though in the original\\nthere are no parenthesis-marks or hyphens, and the reader is left to\\nflounder through to the remote verb the best way he can:\\n\\n\"But when he, upon the street, the (in-satin-and-silk-covered-now-very\\n-unconstrained-after-the-newest-fashioned-dressed)government counselor\\'s\\nwife _met_,\" etc., etc. [1]\\n\\n1. Wenn er aber auf der Strasse der in Sammt und Seide gehuellten\\njetz sehr ungenirt nach der neusten mode gekleideten Regierungsrathin\\nbegegnet.\\n\\nThat is from _The Old Mamselle\\'s Secret_, by Mrs. Marlitt. And that\\nsentence is constructed upon the most approved German model. You observe\\nhow far that verb is from the reader\\'s base of operations; well, in a\\nGerman newspaper they put their verb away over on the next page; and\\nI have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting\\npreliminaries and parentheses for a column or two, they get in a hurry\\nand have to go to press without getting to the verb at all. Of course,\\nthen, the reader is left in a very exhausted and ignorant state.\\n\\nWe have the Parenthesis disease in our literature, too; and one may see\\ncases of it every day in our books and newspapers: but with us it is the\\nmark and sign of an unpracticed writer or a cloudy intellect, whereas\\nwith the Germans it is doubtless the mark and sign of a practiced pen\\nand of the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual fog which\\nstands for clearness among these people. For surely it is _not_\\nclearness--it necessarily can\\'t be clearness. Even a jury would have\\npenetration enough to discover that. A writer\\'s ideas must be a good\\ndeal confused, a good deal out of line and sequence, when he starts out\\nto say that a man met a counselor\\'s wife in the street, and then right\\nin the midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching\\npeople and makes them stand still until he jots down an inventory of the\\nwoman\\'s dress. That is manifestly absurd. It reminds a person of those\\ndentists who secure your instant and breathless interest in a tooth by\\ntaking a grip on it with the forceps, and then stand there and\\ndrawl through a tedious anecdote before they give the dreaded jerk.\\nParentheses in literature and dentistry are in bad taste.\\n\\nThe Germans have another kind of parenthesis, which they make by\\nsplitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of an\\nexciting chapter and the _other half_ at the end of it. Can any one\\nconceive of anything more confusing than that? These things are called\\n\"separable verbs.\" The German grammar is blistered all over with\\nseparable verbs; and the wider the two portions of one of them are\\nspread apart, the better the author of the crime is pleased with his\\nperformance. A favorite one is _reiste ab_--which means departed. Here\\nis an example which I culled from a novel and reduced to English:\\n\\n\"The trunks being now ready, he _de-_ after kissing his mother and\\nsisters, and once more pressing to his bosom his adored Gretchen, who,\\ndressed in simple white muslin, with a single tuberose in the ample\\nfolds of her rich brown hair, had tottered feebly down the stairs, still\\npale from the terror and excitement of the past evening, but longing to\\nlay her poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she\\nloved more dearly than life itself, _parted_.\"\\n\\nHowever, it is not well to dwell too much on the separable verbs. One is\\nsure to lose his temper early; and if he sticks to the subject, and will\\nnot be warned, it will at last either soften his brain or petrify\\nit. Personal pronouns and adjectives are a fruitful nuisance in this\\nlanguage, and should have been left out. For instance, the same sound,\\n_sie_, means _you_, and it means _she_, and it means _her_, and it means\\n_it_, and it means _they_, and it means _them_. Think of the ragged\\npoverty of a language which has to make one word do the work of six--and\\na poor little weak thing of only three letters at that. But mainly,\\nthink of the exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the\\nspeaker is trying to convey. This explains why, whenever a person says\\n_sie_ to me, I generally try to kill him, if a stranger.\\n\\nNow observe the Adjective. Here was a case where simplicity would have\\nbeen an advantage; therefore, for no other reason, the inventor of this\\nlanguage complicated it all he could. When we wish to speak of our \"good\\nfriend or friends,\" in our enlightened tongue, we stick to the one form\\nand have no trouble or hard feeling about it; but with the German\\ntongue it is different. When a German gets his hands on an adjective,\\nhe declines it, and keeps on declining it until the common sense is all\\ndeclined out of it. It is as bad as Latin. He says, for instance:\\n\\nSINGULAR\\n\\nNominative--Mein gut_er_ Freund, my good friend. Genitives--Mein_es_\\nGut_en_ Freund_es_, of my good friend. Dative--Mein_em_ gut_en_ Freund,\\nto my good friend. Accusative--Mein_en_ gut_en_ Freund, my good friend.\\n\\nPLURAL\\n\\nN.--Mein_e_ gut_en_ Freund_e_, my good friends. G.--Mein_er_ gut_en_\\nFreund_e_, of my good friends. D.--Mein_en_ gut_en_ Freund_en_, to my\\ngood friends. A.--Mein_e_ gut_en_ Freund_e_, my good friends.\\n\\nNow let the candidate for the asylum try to memorize those variations,\\nand see how soon he will be elected. One might better go without friends\\nin Germany than take all this trouble about them. I have shown what a\\nbother it is to decline a good (male) friend; well this is only a third\\nof the work, for there is a variety of new distortions of the adjective\\nto be learned when the object is feminine, and still another when the\\nobject is neuter. Now there are more adjectives in this language than\\nthere are black cats in Switzerland, and they must all be as\\nelaborately declined as the examples above suggested.\\nDifficult?--troublesome?--these words cannot describe it. I heard a\\nCalifornian student in Heidelberg say, in one of his calmest moods, that\\nhe would rather decline two drinks than one German adjective.\\n\\nThe inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in\\ncomplicating it in every way he could think of. For instance, if one is\\ncasually referring to a house, _haus_, or a horse, _pferd_, or a\\ndog, _hund_, he spells these words as I have indicated; but if he\\nis referring to them in the Dative case, he sticks on a foolish and\\nunnecessary E and spells them _hause, pferde, hunde_. So, as an added\\nE often signifies the plural, as the S does with us, the new student is\\nlikely to go on for a month making twins out of a Dative dog before he\\ndiscovers his mistake; and on the other hand, many a new student who\\ncould ill afford loss, has bought and paid for two dogs and only got one\\nof them, because he ignorantly bought that dog in the Dative singular\\nwhen he really supposed he was talking plural--which left the law on the\\nseller\\'s side, of course, by the strict rules of grammar, and therefore\\na suit for recovery could not lie.\\n\\nIn German, all the Nouns begin with a capital letter. Now that is a good\\nidea; and a good idea, in this language, is necessarily conspicuous from\\nits lonesomeness. I consider this capitalizing of nouns a good idea,\\nbecause by reason of it you are almost always able to tell a noun the\\nminute you see it. You fall into error occasionally, because you mistake\\nthe name of a person for the name of a thing, and waste a good deal of\\ntime trying to dig a meaning out of it. German names almost always do\\nmean something, and this helps to deceive the student. I translated a\\npassage one day, which said that \"the infuriated tigress broke loose\\nand utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest\" (Tannenwald). When I was\\ngirding up my loins to doubt this, I found out that Tannenwald in this\\ninstance was a man\\'s name.\\n\\nEvery noun has a gender, and there is no sense or system in the\\ndistribution; so the gender of each must be learned separately and by\\nheart. There is no other way. To do this one has to have a memory like a\\nmemorandum-book. In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has.\\nThink what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip, and what\\ncallous disrespect for the girl. See how it looks in print--I translate\\nthis from a conversation in one of the best of the German Sunday-school\\nbooks:\\n\\n\"Gretchen. Wilhelm, where is the turnip?\\n\\n\"Wilhelm. She has gone to the kitchen.\\n\\n\"Gretchen. Where is the accomplished and beautiful English maiden?\\n\\n\"Wilhelm. It has gone to the opera.\"\\n\\nTo continue with the German genders: a tree is male, its buds are\\nfemale, its leaves are neuter; horses are sexless, dogs are male, cats\\nare female--tomcats included, of course; a person\\'s mouth, neck, bosom,\\nelbows, fingers, nails, feet, and body are of the male sex, and his\\nhead is male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it,\\nand _not_ according to the sex of the individual who wears it--for in\\nGermany all the women wear either male heads or sexless ones; a person\\'s\\nnose, lips, shoulders, breast, hands, and toes are of the female sex;\\nand his hair, ears, eyes, chin, legs, knees, heart, and conscience\\nhaven\\'t any sex at all. The inventor of the language probably got what\\nhe knew about a conscience from hearsay.\\n\\nNow, by the above dissection, the reader will see that in Germany a\\nman may _think_ he is a man, but when he comes to look into the matter\\nclosely, he is bound to have his doubts; he finds that in sober truth\\nhe is a most ridiculous mixture; and if he ends by trying to comfort\\nhimself with the thought that he can at least depend on a third of this\\nmess as being manly and masculine, the humiliating second thought will\\nquickly remind him that in this respect he is no better off than any\\nwoman or cow in the land.\\n\\nIn the German it is true that by some oversight of the inventor of\\nthe language, a Woman is a female; but a Wife (Weib) is not--which is\\nunfortunate. A Wife, here, has no sex; she is neuter; so, according to\\nthe grammar, a fish is _he_, his scales are _she_, but a fishwife is\\nneither. To describe a wife as sexless may be called under-description;\\nthat is bad enough, but over-description is surely worse. A German\\nspeaks of an Englishman as the _Englnnder_; to change the sex, he\\nadds INN, and that stands for Englishwoman--_Englnderinn_. That seems\\ndescriptive enough, but still it is not exact enough for a German; so he\\nprecedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to\\nfollow is feminine, and writes it down thus: \"die Englnderinn,\"--which\\nmeans \"the she-Englishwoman.\" I consider that that person is\\nover-described.\\n\\nWell, after the student has learned the sex of a great number of nouns,\\nhe is still in a difficulty, because he finds it impossible to persuade\\nhis tongue to refer to things as \"he\" and \"she,\" and \"him\" and \"her,\"\\nwhich it has been always accustomed to refer to as \"it.\" When he even\\nframes a German sentence in his mind, with the hims and hers in the\\nright places, and then works up his courage to the utterance-point, it\\nis no use--the moment he begins to speak his tongue flies the track and\\nall those labored males and females come out as \"its.\" And even when he\\nis reading German to himself, he always calls those things \"it,\" whereas\\nhe ought to read in this way:\\n\\nTALE OF THE FISHWIFE AND ITS SAD FATE [2]\\n\\n2. I capitalize the nouns, in the German (and ancient English) fashion.\\n\\nIt is a bleak Day. Hear the Rain, how he pours, and the Hail, how he\\nrattles; and see the Snow, how he drifts along, and of the Mud, how\\ndeep he is! Ah the poor Fishwife, it is stuck fast in the Mire; it has\\ndropped its Basket of Fishes; and its Hands have been cut by the Scales\\nas it seized some of the falling Creatures; and one Scale has even got\\ninto its Eye, and it cannot get her out. It opens its Mouth to cry\\nfor Help; but if any Sound comes out of him, alas he is drowned by the\\nraging of the Storm. And now a Tomcat has got one of the Fishes and she\\nwill surely escape with him. No, she bites off a Fin, she holds her in\\nher Mouth--will she swallow her? No, the Fishwife\\'s brave Mother-dog\\ndeserts his Puppies and rescues the Fin--which he eats, himself, as his\\nReward. O, horror, the Lightning has struck the Fish-basket; he sets him\\non Fire; see the Flame, how she licks the doomed Utensil with her red\\nand angry Tongue; now she attacks the helpless Fishwife\\'s Foot--she\\nburns him up, all but the big Toe, and even _She_ is partly consumed;\\nand still she spreads, still she waves her fiery Tongues; she attacks\\nthe Fishwife\\'s Leg and destroys _it_; she attacks its Hand and destroys\\n_Her_ also; she attacks the Fishwife\\'s Leg and destroys _Her_ also;\\nshe attacks its Body and consumes _Him_; she wreathes herself about its\\nHeart and _it_ is consumed; next about its Breast, and in a Moment _She_\\nis a Cinder; now she reaches its Neck--He goes; now its Chin--_it_\\ngoes; now its Nose--_She_ goes. In another Moment, except Help come,\\nthe Fishwife will be no more. Time presses--is there none to succor and\\nsave? Yes! Joy, joy, with flying Feet the she-Englishwoman comes!\\nBut alas, the generous she-Female is too late: where now is the fated\\nFishwife? It has ceased from its Sufferings, it has gone to a better\\nLand; all that is left of it for its loved Ones to lament over, is this\\npoor smoldering Ash-heap. Ah, woeful, woeful Ash-heap! Let us take him\\nup tenderly, reverently, upon the lowly Shovel, and bear him to his long\\nRest, with the Prayer that when he rises again it will be a Realm\\nwhere he will have one good square responsible Sex, and have it all to\\nhimself, instead of having a mangy lot of assorted Sexes scattered all\\nover him in Spots.\\n\\nThere, now, the reader can see for himself that this pronoun business is\\na very awkward thing for the unaccustomed tongue. I suppose that in all\\nlanguages the similarities of look and sound between words which have\\nno similarity in meaning are a fruitful source of perplexity to the\\nforeigner. It is so in our tongue, and it is notably the case in the\\nGerman. Now there is that troublesome word _vermhlt_: to me it has\\nso close a resemblance--either real or fancied--to three or four other\\nwords, that I never know whether it means despised, painted, suspected,\\nor married; until I look in the dictionary, and then I find it means the\\nlatter. There are lots of such words and they are a great torment. To\\nincrease the difficulty there are words which _seem_ to resemble each\\nother, and yet do not; but they make just as much trouble as if they\\ndid. For instance, there is the word _vermiethen_ (to let, to lease, to\\nhire); and the word _verheirathen_ (another way of saying to marry).\\nI heard of an Englishman who knocked at a man\\'s door in Heidelberg and\\nproposed, in the best German he could command, to \"verheirathen\" that\\nhouse. Then there are some words which mean one thing when you emphasize\\nthe first syllable, but mean something very different if you throw the\\nemphasis on the last syllable. For instance, there is a word which\\nmeans a runaway, or the act of glancing through a book, according to the\\nplacing of the emphasis; and another word which signifies to _associate_\\nwith a man, or to _avoid_ him, according to where you put the\\nemphasis--and you can generally depend on putting it in the wrong place\\nand getting into trouble.\\n\\nThere are some exceedingly useful words in this language. _Schlag_, for\\nexample; and _zug_. There are three-quarters of a column of _schlags_\\nin the dictonary, and a column and a half of _zugs_. The word _schlag_\\nmeans Blow, Stroke, Dash, Hit, Shock, Clap, Slap, Time, Bar, Coin,\\nStamp, Kind, Sort, Manner, Way, Apoplexy, Wood-cutting, Enclosure,\\nField, Forest-clearing. This is its simple and _exact_ meaning--that\\nis to say, its restricted, its fettered meaning; but there are ways by\\nwhich you can set it free, so that it can soar away, as on the wings of\\nthe morning, and never be at rest. You can hang any word you please\\nto its tail, and make it mean anything you want to. You can begin\\nwith _schlag-ader_, which means artery, and you can hang on the whole\\ndictionary, word by word, clear through the alphabet to _schlag-wasser_,\\nwhich means bilge-water--and including _schlag-mutte_R, which means\\nmother-in-law.\\n\\nJust the same with _zug_. Strictly speaking, _zug_ means Pull, Tug,\\nDraught, Procession, March, Progress, Flight, Direction, Expedition,\\nTrain, Caravan, Passage, Stroke, Touch, Line, Flourish, Trait of\\nCharacter, Feature, Lineament, Chess-move, Organ-stop, Team, Whiff,\\nBias, Drawer, Propensity, Inhalation, Disposition: but that thing which\\nit does _not_ mean--when all its legitimate pennants have been hung on,\\nhas not been discovered yet.\\n\\nOne cannot overestimate the usefulness of _schlag_ and _zug_. Armed just\\nwith these two, and the word _also_, what cannot the foreigner on German\\nsoil accomplish? The German word _also_ is the equivalent of the English\\nphrase \"You know,\" and does not mean anything at all--in _talk_, though\\nit sometimes does in print. Every time a German opens his mouth an\\n_also_ falls out; and every time he shuts it he bites one in two that\\nwas trying to _get_ out.\\n\\nNow, the foreigner, equipped with these three noble words, is master of\\nthe situation. Let him talk right along, fearlessly; let him pour his\\nindifferent German forth, and when he lacks for a word, let him heave\\na _schlag_ into the vacuum; all the chances are that it fits it like a\\nplug, but if it doesn\\'t let him promptly heave a _zug_ after it; the two\\ntogether can hardly fail to bung the hole; but if, by a miracle, they\\n_should_ fail, let him simply say _also_! and this will give him a\\nmoment\\'s chance to think of the needful word. In Germany, when you load\\nyour conversational gun it is always best to throw in a _schlag_ or two\\nand a _zug_ or two, because it doesn\\'t make any difference how much\\nthe rest of the charge may scatter, you are bound to bag something with\\n_them_. Then you blandly say _also_, and load up again. Nothing gives\\nsuch an air of grace and elegance and unconstraint to a German or an\\nEnglish conversation as to scatter it full of \"Also\\'s\" or \"You knows.\"\\n\\nIn my note-book I find this entry:\\n\\nJuly 1.--In the hospital yesterday, a word of thirteen syllables was\\nsuccessfully removed from a patient--a North German from near Hamburg;\\nbut as most unfortunately the surgeons had opened him in the wrong\\nplace, under the impression that he contained a panorama, he died. The\\nsad event has cast a gloom over the whole community.\\n\\nThat paragraph furnishes a text for a few remarks about one of the most\\ncurious and notable features of my subject--the length of German words.\\nSome German words are so long that they have a perspective. Observe\\nthese examples:\\n\\nFreundschaftsbezeigungen.\\n\\nDilettantenaufdringlichkeiten.\\n\\nStadtverordnetenversammlungen.\\n\\nThese things are not words, they are alphabetical processions. And they\\nare not rare; one can open a German newspaper at any time and see them\\nmarching majestically across the page--and if he has any imagination\\nhe can see the banners and hear the music, too. They impart a martial\\nthrill to the meekest subject. I take a great interest in these\\ncuriosities. Whenever I come across a good one, I stuff it and put it in\\nmy museum. In this way I have made quite a valuable collection. When I\\nget duplicates, I exchange with other collectors, and thus increase the\\nvariety of my stock. Here are some specimens which I lately bought at an\\nauction sale of the effects of a bankrupt bric-a-brac hunter:\\n\\nGeneralstaatsverordnetenversammlungen.\\n\\nAlterthumswissenschaften.\\n\\nKinderbewahrungsanstalten.\\n\\nUnabhngigkeitserklrungen.\\n\\nWiedererstellungbestrebungen.\\n\\nWaffenstillstandsunterhandlungen.\\n\\nOf course when one of these grand mountain ranges goes stretching across\\nthe printed page, it adorns and ennobles that literary landscape--but at\\nthe same time it is a great distress to the new student, for it blocks\\nup his way; he cannot crawl under it, or climb over it, or tunnel\\nthrough it. So he resorts to the dictionary for help, but there is no\\nhelp there. The dictionary must draw the line somewhere--so it leaves\\nthis sort of words out. And it is right, because these long things are\\nhardly legitimate words, but are rather combinations of words, and the\\ninventor of them ought to have been killed. They are compound words with\\nthe hyphens left out. The various words used in building them are in\\nthe dictionary, but in a very scattered condition; so you can hunt the\\nmaterials out, one by one, and get at the meaning at last, but it is a\\ntedious and harassing business. I have tried this process upon some of\\nthe above examples. \"Freundshaftsbezeigungen\" seems to be \"Friendship\\ndemonstrations,\" which is only a foolish and clumsy way of saying\\n\"demonstrations of friendship.\" \"Unabhngigkeitserklrungen\" seems to be\\n\"Independencedeclarations,\" which is no improvement upon\\n\"Declarations of Independence,\" so far as I can see.\\n\"Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen\" seems to be\\n\"General-statesrepresentativesmeetings,\" as nearly as I can get at it--a\\nmere rhythmical, gushy euphemism for \"meetings of the legislature,\"\\nI judge. We used to have a good deal of this sort of crime in our\\nliterature, but it has gone out now. We used to speak of a thing as a\\n\"never-to-be-forgotten\" circumstance, instead of cramping it into the\\nsimple and sufficient word \"memorable\" and then going calmly about our\\nbusiness as if nothing had happened. In those days we were not content\\nto embalm the thing and bury it decently, we wanted to build a monument\\nover it.\\n\\nBut in our newspapers the compounding-disease lingers a little to the\\npresent day, but with the hyphens left out, in the German fashion. This\\nis the shape it takes: instead of saying \"Mr. Simmons, clerk of the\\ncounty and district courts, was in town yesterday,\" the new form puts\\nit thus: \"Clerk of the County and District Courts Simmons was in town\\nyesterday.\" This saves neither time nor ink, and has an awkward sound\\nbesides. One often sees a remark like this in our papers: \"_Mrs_.\\nAssistant District Attorney Johnson returned to her city residence\\nyesterday for the season.\" That is a case of really unjustifiable\\ncompounding; because it not only saves no time or trouble, but confers\\na title on Mrs. Johnson which she has no right to. But these little\\ninstances are trifles indeed, contrasted with the ponderous and dismal\\nGerman system of piling jumbled compounds together. I wish to submit the\\nfollowing local item, from a Mannheim journal, by way of illustration:\\n\\n\"In the daybeforeyesterdayshortlyaftereleveno\\'clock Night, the\\ninthistownstandingtavern called \\'The Wagoner\\' was downburnt. When the\\nfire to the onthedownburninghouseresting Stork\\'s Nest reached, flew\\nthe parent Storks away. But when the bytheraging, firesurrounded\\nNest _itself_ caught Fire, straightway plunged the quickreturning\\nMother-Stork into the Flames and died, her Wings over her young ones\\noutspread.\"\\n\\nEven the cumbersome German construction is not able to take the pathos\\nout of that picture--indeed, it somehow seems to strengthen it. This\\nitem is dated away back yonder months ago. I could have used it sooner,\\nbut I was waiting to hear from the Father-stork. I am still waiting.\\n\\n\"_Also_!\" If I had not shown that the German is a difficult language, I\\nhave at least intended to do so. I have heard of an American student\\nwho was asked how he was getting along with his German, and who answered\\npromptly: \"I am not getting along at all. I have worked at it hard for\\nthree level months, and all I have got to show for it is one solitary\\nGerman phrase--\\'_zwei glas_\\'\" (two glasses of beer). He paused for\\na moment, reflectively; then added with feeling: \"But I\\'ve got that\\n_solid_!\"\\n\\nAnd if I have not also shown that German is a harassing and infuriating\\nstudy, my execution has been at fault, and not my intent. I heard lately\\nof a worn and sorely tried American student who used to fly to a certain\\nGerman word for relief when he could bear up under his aggravations no\\nlonger--the only word whose sound was sweet and precious to his ear and\\nhealing to his lacerated spirit. This was the word _damit_. It was only\\nthe _sound_ that helped him, not the meaning; [3] and so, at last, when\\nhe learned that the emphasis was not on the first syllable, his only\\nstay and support was gone, and he faded away and died.\\n\\n3. It merely means, in its general sense, \"herewith.\"\\n\\nI think that a description of any loud, stirring, tumultuous episode\\nmust be tamer in German than in English. Our descriptive words of this\\ncharacter have such a deep, strong, resonant sound, while their German\\nequivalents do seem so thin and mild and energyless. Boom, burst, crash,\\nroar, storm, bellow, blow, thunder, explosion; howl, cry, shout, yell,\\ngroan; battle, hell. These are magnificent words; the have a force and\\nmagnitude of sound befitting the things which they describe. But their\\nGerman equivalents would be ever so nice to sing the children to sleep\\nwith, or else my awe-inspiring ears were made for display and not for\\nsuperior usefulness in analyzing sounds. Would any man want to die in a\\nbattle which was called by so tame a term as a _schlacht_? Or would not\\na comsumptive feel too much bundled up, who was about to go out, in\\na shirt-collar and a seal-ring, into a storm which the bird-song word\\n_gewitter_ was employed to describe? And observe the strongest of\\nthe several German equivalents for explosion--_ausbruch_. Our word\\nToothbrush is more powerful than that. It seems to me that the\\nGermans could do worse than import it into their language to\\ndescribe particularly tremendous explosions with. The German word for\\nhell--Hoelle--sounds more like _helly_ than anything else; therefore,\\nhow necessarily chipper, frivolous, and unimpressive it is. If a man\\nwere told in German to go there, could he really rise to thee dignity of\\nfeeling insulted?\\n\\nHaving pointed out, in detail, the several vices of this language, I\\nnow come to the brief and pleasant task of pointing out its virtues. The\\ncapitalizing of the nouns I have already mentioned. But far before this\\nvirtue stands another--that of spelling a word according to the sound of\\nit. After one short lesson in the alphabet, the student can tell how any\\nGerman word is pronounced without having to ask; whereas in our language\\nif a student should inquire of us, \"What does B, O, W, spell?\" we should\\nbe obliged to reply, \"Nobody can tell what it spells when you set if off\\nby itself; you can only tell by referring to the context and finding out\\nwhat it signifies--whether it is a thing to shoot arrows with, or a nod\\nof one\\'s head, or the forward end of a boat.\"\\n\\nThere are some German words which are singularly and powerfully\\neffective. For instance, those which describe lowly, peaceful, and\\naffectionate home life; those which deal with love, in any and all\\nforms, from mere kindly feeling and honest good will toward the passing\\nstranger, clear up to courtship; those which deal with outdoor Nature,\\nin its softest and loveliest aspects--with meadows and forests, and\\nbirds and flowers, the fragrance and sunshine of summer, and the\\nmoonlight of peaceful winter nights; in a word, those which deal with\\nany and all forms of rest, repose, and peace; those also which deal with\\nthe creatures and marvels of fairyland; and lastly and chiefly, in\\nthose words which express pathos, is the language surpassingly rich\\nand affective. There are German songs which can make a stranger to the\\nlanguage cry. That shows that the _sound_ of the words is correct--it\\ninterprets the meanings with truth and with exactness; and so the ear is\\ninformed, and through the ear, the heart.\\n\\nThe Germans do not seem to be afraid to repeat a word when it is the\\nright one. They repeat it several times, if they choose. That is\\nwise. But in English, when we have used a word a couple of times in a\\nparagraph, we imagine we are growing tautological, and so we are weak\\nenough to exchange it for some other word which only approximates\\nexactness, to escape what we wrongly fancy is a greater blemish.\\nRepetition may be bad, but surely inexactness is worse.\\n\\nThere are people in the world who will take a great deal of trouble to\\npoint out the faults in a religion or a language, and then go blandly\\nabout their business without suggesting any remedy. I am not that kind\\nof person. I have shown that the German language needs reforming. Very\\nwell, I am ready to reform it. At least I am ready to make the proper\\nsuggestions. Such a course as this might be immodest in another; but I\\nhave devoted upward of nine full weeks, first and last, to a careful and\\ncritical study of this tongue, and thus have acquired a confidence in\\nmy ability to reform it which no mere superficial culture could have\\nconferred upon me.\\n\\nIn the first place, I would leave out the Dative case. It confuses the\\nplurals; and, besides, nobody ever knows when he is in the Dative case,\\nexcept he discover it by accident--and then he does not know when or\\nwhere it was that he got into it, or how long he has been in it, or\\nhow he is ever going to get out of it again. The Dative case is but an\\nornamental folly--it is better to discard it.\\n\\nIn the next place, I would move the Verb further up to the front. You\\nmay load up with ever so good a Verb, but I notice that you never really\\nbring down a subject with it at the present German range--you only\\ncripple it. So I insist that this important part of speech should be\\nbrought forward to a position where it may be easily seen with the naked\\neye.\\n\\nThirdly, I would import some strong words from the English tongue--to\\nswear with, and also to use in describing all sorts of vigorous things\\nin a vigorous way. [4]\\n\\n1. \"Verdammt,\" and its variations and enlargements, are words which have\\nplenty of meaning, but the _sounds_ are so mild and ineffectual that\\nGerman ladies can use them without sin. German ladies who could not be\\ninduced to commit a sin by any persuasion or compulsion, promptly rip\\nout one of these harmless little words when they tear their dresses or\\ndon\\'t like the soup. It sounds about as wicked as our \"My gracious.\"\\nGerman ladies are constantly saying, \"Ach! Gott!\" \"Mein Gott!\" \"Gott in\\nHimmel!\" \"Herr Gott\" \"Der Herr Jesus!\" etc. They think our ladies have\\nthe same custom, perhaps; for I once heard a gentle and lovely old\\nGerman lady say to a sweet young American girl: \"The two languages are\\nso alike--how pleasant that is; we say \\'Ach! Gott!\\' you say \\'Goddamn.\\'\"\\n\\nFourthly, I would reorganizes the sexes, and distribute them accordingly\\nto the will of the creator. This as a tribute of respect, if nothing\\nelse.\\n\\nFifthly, I would do away with those great long compounded words; or\\nrequire the speaker to deliver them in sections, with intermissions for\\nrefreshments. To wholly do away with them would be best, for ideas are\\nmore easily received and digested when they come one at a time than when\\nthey come in bulk. Intellectual food is like any other; it is pleasanter\\nand more beneficial to take it with a spoon than with a shovel.\\n\\nSixthly, I would require a speaker to stop when he is done, and not\\nhang a string of those useless \"haven sind gewesen gehabt haben geworden\\nseins\" to the end of his oration. This sort of gewgaws undignify a\\nspeech, instead of adding a grace. They are, therefore, an offense, and\\nshould be discarded.\\n\\nSeventhly, I would discard the Parenthesis. Also the reparenthesis, the\\nre-reparenthesis, and the re-re-re-re-re-reparentheses, and likewise\\nthe final wide-reaching all-enclosing king-parenthesis. I would require\\nevery individual, be he high or low, to unfold a plain straightforward\\ntale, or else coil it and sit on it and hold his peace. Infractions of\\nthis law should be punishable with death.\\n\\nAnd eighthly, and last, I would retain _zug_ and _schlag_, with their\\npendants, and discard the rest of the vocabulary. This would simplify\\nthe language.\\n\\nI have now named what I regard as the most necessary and important\\nchanges. These are perhaps all I could be expected to name for nothing;\\nbut there are other suggestions which I can and will make in case my\\nproposed application shall result in my being formally employed by the\\ngovernment in the work of reforming the language.\\n\\nMy philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to\\nlearn English (barring spelling and pronouncing) in thirty hours, French\\nin thirty days, and German in thirty years. It seems manifest, then,\\nthat the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired. If it is\\nto remain as it is, it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among\\nthe dead languages, for only the dead have time to learn it.\\n\\nA FOURTH OF JULY ORATION IN THE GERMAN TONGUE, DELIVERED AT A BANQUET OF\\nTHE ANGLO-AMERICAN CLUB OF STUDENTS BY THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK\\n\\nGentlemen: Since I arrived, a month ago, in this old wonderland, this\\nvast garden of Germany, my English tongue has so often proved a useless\\npiece of baggage to me, and so troublesome to carry around, in a country\\nwhere they haven\\'t the checking system for luggage, that I finally set\\nto work, and learned the German language. Also! Es freut mich dass dies\\nso ist, denn es muss, in ein hauptschlich degree, hflich sein, dass\\nman auf ein occasion like this, sein Rede in die Sprache des Landes\\nworin he boards, aussprechen soll. Dafuer habe ich, aus reinische\\nVerlegenheit--no, Vergangenheit--no, I mean Hflichkeit--aus reinishe\\nHflichkeit habe ich resolved to tackle this business in the German\\nlanguage, um Gottes willen! Also! Sie muessen so freundlich sein, und\\nverzeih mich die interlarding von ein oder zwei Englischer Worte, hie\\nund da, denn ich finde dass die deutsche is not a very copious language,\\nand so when you\\'ve really got anything to say, you\\'ve got to draw on a\\nlanguage that can stand the strain.\\n\\nWenn haber man kann nicht meinem Rede Verstehen, so werde ich ihm spter\\ndasselbe uebersetz, wenn er solche Dienst verlangen wollen haben werden\\nsollen sein htte. (I don\\'t know what wollen haben werden sollen sein\\nhtte means, but I notice they always put it at the end of a German\\nsentence--merely for general literary gorgeousness, I suppose.)\\n\\nThis is a great and justly honored day--a day which is worthy of the\\nveneration in which it is held by the true patriots of all climes and\\nnationalities--a day which offers a fruitful theme for thought\\nand speech; und meinem Freunde--no, mein_en_ Freund_en_--mein_es_\\nFreund_es_--well, take your choice, they\\'re all the same price; I don\\'t\\nknow which one is right--also! ich habe gehabt haben worden gewesen\\nsein, as Goethe says in his Paradise Lost--ich--ich--that is to\\nsay--ich--but let us change cars.\\n\\nAlso! Die Anblich so viele Grossbrittanischer und Amerikanischer\\nhier zusammengetroffen in Bruderliche concord, ist zwar a welcome and\\ninspiriting spectacle. And what has moved you to it? Can the\\nterse German tongue rise to the expression of this impulse? Is it\\nFreundschaftsbezeigungenstadtverordnetenversammlungenfamilieneigenthmlichkeiten?\\nNein, O nein! This is a crisp and noble word, but it fails to pierce\\nthe marrow of the impulse which has gathered this friendly meeting and\\nproduced diese Anblick--eine Anblich welche ist gut zu sehen--gut fuer\\ndie Augen in a foreign land and a far country--eine Anblick solche als\\nin die gewhnliche Heidelberger phrase nennt man ein \"schnes Aussicht!\"\\nJa, freilich natrlich wahrscheinlich ebensowohl! Also! Die Aussicht auf\\ndem Koenigsstuhl mehr grsser ist, aber geistlische sprechend nicht\\nso schn, lob\\' Gott! Because sie sind hier zusammengetroffen, in\\nBruderlichem concord, ein grossen Tag zu feirn, whose high benefits were\\nnot for one land and one locality, but have conferred a measure of\\ngood upon all lands that know liberty today, and love it. Hundert Jahre\\nvorueber, waren die Englnder und die Amerikaner Feinde; aber heut sind\\nsie herzlichen Freunde, Gott sei Dank! May this good-fellowship endure;\\nmay these banners here blended in amity so remain; may they never\\nany more wave over opposing hosts, or be stained with blood which was\\nkindred, is kindred, and always will be kindred, until a line drawn\\nupon a map shall be able to say: \"_This_ bars the ancestral blood from\\nflowing in the veins of the descendant!\"\\n\\nAPPENDIX E.\\n\\nLEGEND OF THE CASTLES\\n\\nCalled the \"Swallow\\'s Nest\" and \"The Brothers,\" as Condensed from the\\nCaptain\\'s Tale\\n\\nIn the neighborhood of three hundred years ago the Swallow\\'s Nest and\\nthe larger castle between it and Neckarsteinach were owned and occupied\\nby two old knights who were twin brothers, and bachelors. They had no\\nrelatives. They were very rich. They had fought through the wars and\\nretired to private life--covered with honorable scars. They were honest,\\nhonorable men in their dealings, but the people had given them a couple\\nof nicknames which were very suggestive--Herr Givenaught and Herr\\nHeartless. The old knights were so proud of these names that if a\\nburgher called them by their right ones they would correct them.\\n\\nThe most renowned scholar in Europe, at the time, was the Herr Doctor\\nFranz Reikmann, who lived in Heidelberg. All Germany was proud of the\\nvenerable scholar, who lived in the simplest way, for great scholars are\\nalways poor. He was poor, as to money, but very rich in his sweet young\\ndaughter Hildegarde and his library. He had been all his life collecting\\nhis library, book and book, and he lived it as a miser loves his hoarded\\ngold. He said the two strings of his heart were rooted, the one in his\\ndaughter, the other in his books; and that if either were severed he\\nmust die. Now in an evil hour, hoping to win a marriage portion for his\\nchild, this simple old man had intrusted his small savings to a sharper\\nto be ventured in a glittering speculation. But that was not the worst\\nof it: he signed a paper--without reading it. That is the way with poets\\nand scholars; they always sign without reading. This cunning paper made\\nhim responsible for heaps of things. The rest was that one night he\\nfound himself in debt to the sharper eight thousand pieces of gold!--an\\namount so prodigious that it simply stupefied him to think of it. It was\\na night of woe in that house.\\n\\n\"I must part with my library--I have nothing else. So perishes one\\nheartstring,\" said the old man.\\n\\n\"What will it bring, father?\" asked the girl.\\n\\n\"Nothing! It is worth seven hundred pieces of gold; but by auction it\\nwill go for little or nothing.\"\\n\\n\"Then you will have parted with the half of your heart and the joy of\\nyour life to no purpose, since so mighty a burden of debt will remain\\nbehind.\"\\n\\n\"There is no help for it, my child. Our darlings must pass under the\\nhammer. We must pay what we can.\"\\n\\n\"My father, I have a feeling that the dear Virgin will come to our help.\\nLet us not lose heart.\"\\n\\n\"She cannot devise a miracle that will turn _nothing_ into eight\\nthousand gold pieces, and lesser help will bring us little peace.\"\\n\\n\"She can do even greater things, my father. She will save us, I know she\\nwill.\"\\n\\nToward morning, while the old man sat exhausted and asleep in his chair\\nwhere he had been sitting before his books as one who watches by his\\nbeloved dead and prints the features on his memory for a solace in the\\naftertime of empty desolation, his daughter sprang into the room and\\ngently woke him, saying--\\n\\n\"My presentiment was true! She will save us. Three times has she\\nappeared to me in my dreams, and said, \\'Go to the Herr Givenaught, go to\\nthe Herr Heartless, ask them to come and bid.\\' There, did I not tell you\\nshe would save us, the thrice blessed Virgin!\"\\n\\nSad as the old man was, he was obliged to laugh.\\n\\n\"Thou mightest as well appeal to the rocks their castles stand upon as\\nto the harder ones that lie in those men\\'s breasts, my child. _They_ bid\\non books writ in the learned tongues!--they can scarce read their own.\"\\n\\nBut Hildegarde\\'s faith was in no wise shaken. Bright and early she was\\non her way up the Neckar road, as joyous as a bird.\\n\\nMeantime Herr Givenaught and Herr Heartless were having an early\\nbreakfast in the former\\'s castle--the Sparrow\\'s Nest--and flavoring\\nit with a quarrel; for although these twins bore a love for each other\\nwhich almost amounted to worship, there was one subject upon which they\\ncould not touch without calling each other hard names--and yet it was\\nthe subject which they oftenest touched upon.\\n\\n\"I tell you,\" said Givenaught, \"you will beggar yourself yet with your\\ninsane squanderings of money upon what you choose to consider poor and\\nworthy objects. All these years I have implored you to stop this foolish\\ncustom and husband your means, but all in vain. You are always lying\\nto me about these secret benevolences, but you never have managed to\\ndeceive me yet. Every time a poor devil has been set upon his feet I\\nhave detected your hand in it--incorrigible ass!\"\\n\\n\"Every time you didn\\'t set him on his feet yourself, you mean. Where I\\ngive one unfortunate a little private lift, you do the same for a dozen.\\nThe idea of _your_ swelling around the country and petting yourself with\\nthe nickname of Givenaught--intolerable humbug! Before I would be such\\na fraud as that, I would cut my right hand off. Your life is a continual\\nlie. But go on, I have tried _my_ best to save you from beggaring\\nyourself by your riotous charities--now for the thousandth time I wash\\nmy hands of the consequences. A maundering old fool! that\\'s what you\\nare.\"\\n\\n\"And you a blethering old idiot!\" roared Givenaught, springing up.\\n\\n\"I won\\'t stay in the presence of a man who has no more delicacy than to\\ncall me such names. Mannerless swine!\"\\n\\nSo saying, Herr Heartless sprang up in a passion. But some lucky\\naccident intervened, as usual, to change the subject, and the daily\\nquarrel ended in the customary daily living reconciliation. The\\ngray-headed old eccentrics parted, and Herr Heartless walked off to his\\nown castle.\\n\\nHalf an hour later, Hildegarde was standing in the presence of Herr\\nGivenaught. He heard her story, and said--\\n\\n\"I am sorry for you, my child, but I am very poor, I care nothing for\\nbookish rubbish, I shall not be there.\"\\n\\nHe said the hard words kindly, but they nearly broke poor Hildegarde\\'s\\nheart, nevertheless. When she was gone the old heartbreaker muttered,\\nrubbing his hands--\\n\\n\"It was a good stroke. I have saved my brother\\'s pocket this time,\\nin spite of him. Nothing else would have prevented his rushing off to\\nrescue the old scholar, the pride of Germany, from his trouble. The poor\\nchild won\\'t venture near _him_ after the rebuff she has received from\\nhis brother the Givenaught.\"\\n\\nBut he was mistaken. The Virgin had commanded, and Hildegarde would\\nobey. She went to Herr Heartless and told her story. But he said\\ncoldly--\\n\\n\"I am very poor, my child, and books are nothing to me. I wish you well,\\nbut I shall not come.\"\\n\\nWhen Hildegarde was gone, he chuckled and said--\\n\\n\"How my fool of a soft-headed soft-hearted brother would rage if he knew\\nhow cunningly I have saved his pocket. How he would have flown to the\\nold man\\'s rescue! But the girl won\\'t venture near him now.\"\\n\\nWhen Hildegarde reached home, her father asked her how she had\\nprospered. She said--\\n\\n\"The Virgin has promised, and she will keep her word; but not in the way\\nI thought. She knows her own ways, and they are best.\"\\n\\nThe old man patted her on the head, and smiled a doubting smile, but he\\nhonored her for her brave faith, nevertheless.\\n\\nII\\n\\nNext day the people assembled in the great hall of the Ritter tavern,\\nto witness the auction--for the proprietor had said the treasure of\\nGermany\\'s most honored son should be bartered away in no meaner place.\\nHildegarde and her father sat close to the books, silent and sorrowful,\\nand holding each other\\'s hands. There was a great crowd of people\\npresent. The bidding began--\\n\\n\"How much for this precious library, just as it stands, all complete?\"\\ncalled the auctioneer.\\n\\n\"Fifty pieces of gold!\"\\n\\n\"A hundred!\"\\n\\n\"Two hundred.\"\\n\\n\"Three!\"\\n\\n\"Four!\"\\n\\n\"Five hundred!\"\\n\\n\"Five twenty-five.\"\\n\\nA brief pause.\\n\\n\"Five forty!\"\\n\\nA longer pause, while the auctioneer redoubled his persuasions.\\n\\n\"Five-forty-five!\"\\n\\nA heavy drag--the auctioneer persuaded, pleaded, implored--it was\\nuseless, everybody remained silent--\\n\\n\"Well, then--going, going--one--two--\"\\n\\n\"Five hundred and fifty!\"\\n\\nThis in a shrill voice, from a bent old man, all hung with rags, and\\nwith a green patch over his left eye. Everybody in his vicinity\\nturned and gazed at him. It was Givenaught in disguise. He was using a\\ndisguised voice, too.\\n\\n\"Good!\" cried the auctioneer. \"Going, going--one--two--\"\\n\\n\"Five hundred and sixty!\"\\n\\nThis, in a deep, harsh voice, from the midst of the crowd at the other\\nend of the room. The people near by turned, and saw an old man, in a\\nstrange costume, supporting himself on crutches. He wore a long white\\nbeard, and blue spectacles. It was Herr Heartless, in disguise, and\\nusing a disguised voice.\\n\\n\"Good again! Going, going--one--\"\\n\\n\"Six hundred!\"\\n\\nSensation. The crowd raised a cheer, and some one cried out, \"Go it,\\nGreen-patch!\" This tickled the audience and a score of voices shouted,\\n\"Go it, Green-patch!\"\\n\\n\"Going--going--going--third and last call--one--two--\"\\n\\n\"Seven hundred!\"\\n\\n\"Huzzah!--well done, Crutches!\" cried a voice. The crowd took it up, and\\nshouted altogether, \"Well done, Crutches!\"\\n\\n\"Splendid, gentlemen! you are doing magnificently. Going, going--\"\\n\\n\"A thousand!\"\\n\\n\"Three cheers for Green-patch! Up and at him, Crutches!\"\\n\\n\"Going--going--\"\\n\\n\"Two thousand!\"\\n\\nAnd while the people cheered and shouted, \"Crutches\" muttered, \"Who can\\nthis devil be that is fighting so to get these useless books?--But no\\nmatter, he sha\\'n\\'t have them. The pride of Germany shall have his books\\nif it beggars me to buy them for him.\"\\n\\n\"Going, going, going--\"\\n\\n\"Three thousand!\"\\n\\n\"Come, everybody--give a rouser for Green-patch!\"\\n\\nAnd while they did it, \"Green-patch\" muttered, \"This cripple is plainly\\na lunatic; but the old scholar shall have his books, nevertheless,\\nthough my pocket sweat for it.\"\\n\\n\"Going--going--\"\\n\\n\"Four thousand!\"\\n\\n\"Huzza!\"\\n\\n\"Five thousand!\"\\n\\n\"Huzza!\"\\n\\n\"Six thousand!\"\\n\\n\"Huzza!\"\\n\\n\"Seven thousand!\"\\n\\n\"Huzza!\"\\n\\n\"_Eight_ thousand!\"\\n\\n\"We are saved, father! I told you the Holy Virgin would keep her word!\"\\n\"Blessed be her sacred name!\" said the old scholar, with emotion. The\\ncrowd roared, \"Huzza, huzza, huzza--at him again, Green-patch!\"\\n\\n\"Going--going--\"\\n\\n\"_Ten_ thousand!\" As Givenaught shouted this, his excitement was so\\ngreat that he forgot himself and used his natural voice. His brother\\nrecognized it, and muttered, under cover of the storm of cheers--\\n\\n\"Aha, you are there, are you, besotted old fool? Take the books, I know\\nwhat you\\'ll do with them!\"\\n\\nSo saying, he slipped out of the place and the auction was at an end.\\nGivenaught shouldered his way to Hildegarde, whispered a word in\\nher ear, and then he also vanished. The old scholar and his daughter\\nembraced, and the former said, \"Truly the Holy Mother has done more\\nthan she promised, child, for she has given you a splendid marriage\\nportion--think of it, two thousand pieces of gold!\"\\n\\n\"And more still,\" cried Hildegarde, \"for she has given you back your\\nbooks; the stranger whispered me that he would none of them--\\'the\\nhonored son of Germany must keep them,\\' so he said. I would I might have\\nasked his name and kissed his hand and begged his blessing; but he was\\nOur Lady\\'s angel, and it is not meet that we of earth should venture\\nspeech with them that dwell above.\"\\n\\nAPPENDIX F.\\n\\nGERMAN JOURNALS\\n\\nThe daily journals of Hamburg, Frankfort, Baden, Munich, and Augsburg\\nare all constructed on the same general plan. I speak of these because\\nI am more familiar with them than with any other German papers. They\\ncontain no \"editorials\" whatever; no \"personals\"--and this is rather\\na merit than a demerit, perhaps; no funny-paragraph column; no\\npolice-court reports; no reports of proceedings of higher courts;\\nno information about prize-fights or other dog-fights, horse-races,\\nwalking-machines, yachting-contents, rifle-matches, or other sporting\\nmatters of any sort; no reports of banquet speeches; no department of\\ncurious odds and ends of floating fact and gossip; no \"rumors\" about\\nanything or anybody; no prognostications or prophecies about anything or\\nanybody; no lists of patents granted or sought, or any reference to\\nsuch things; no abuse of public officials, big or little, or complaints\\nagainst them, or praises of them; no religious columns Saturdays, no\\nrehash of cold sermons Mondays; no \"weather indications\"; no \"local\\nitem\" unveiling of what is happening in town--nothing of a local nature,\\nindeed, is mentioned, beyond the movements of some prince, or the\\nproposed meeting of some deliberative body.\\n\\nAfter so formidable a list of what one can\\'t find in a German daily,\\nthe question may well be asked, What _can_ be found in it? It is easily\\nanswered: A child\\'s handful of telegrams, mainly about European national\\nand international political movements; letter-correspondence about the\\nsame things; market reports. There you have it. That is what a German\\ndaily is made of. A German daily is the slowest and saddest and\\ndreariest of the inventions of man. Our own dailies infuriate the\\nreader, pretty often; the German daily only stupefies him. Once a\\nweek the German daily of the highest class lightens up its heavy\\ncolumns--that is, it thinks it lightens them up--with a profound, an\\nabysmal, book criticism; a criticism which carries you down, down, down\\ninto the scientific bowels of the subject--for the German critic is\\nnothing if not scientific--and when you come up at last and scent the\\nfresh air and see the bonny daylight once more, you resolve without a\\ndissenting voice that a book criticism is a mistaken way to lighten up\\na German daily. Sometimes, in place of the criticism, the first-class\\ndaily gives you what it thinks is a gay and chipper essay--about ancient\\nGrecian funeral customs, or the ancient Egyptian method of tarring a\\nmummy, or the reasons for believing that some of the peoples who existed\\nbefore the flood did not approve of cats. These are not unpleasant\\nsubjects; they are not uninteresting subjects; they are even exciting\\nsubjects--until one of these massive scientists gets hold of them. He\\nsoon convinces you that even these matters can be handled in such a way\\nas to make a person low-spirited.\\n\\nAs I have said, the average German daily is made up solely of\\ncorrespondences--a trifle of it by telegraph, the rest of it by mail.\\nEvery paragraph has the side-head, \"London,\" \"Vienna,\" or some other\\ntown, and a date. And always, before the name of the town, is placed\\na letter or a sign, to indicate who the correspondent is, so that the\\nauthorities can find him when they want to hang him. Stars, crosses,\\ntriangles, squares, half-moons, suns--such are some of the signs used by\\ncorrespondents.\\n\\nSome of the dailies move too fast, others too slowly. For instance, my\\nHeidelberg daily was always twenty-four hours old when it arrived at\\nthe hotel; but one of my Munich evening papers used to come a full\\ntwenty-four hours before it was due.\\n\\nSome of the less important dailies give one a tablespoonful of a\\ncontinued story every day; it is strung across the bottom of the page,\\nin the French fashion. By subscribing for the paper for five years I\\njudge that a man might succeed in getting pretty much all of the story.\\n\\nIf you ask a citizen of Munich which is the best Munich daily journal,\\nhe will always tell you that there is only one good Munich daily, and\\nthat it is published in Augsburg, forty or fifty miles away. It is like\\nsaying that the best daily paper in New York is published out in New\\nJersey somewhere. Yes, the Augsburg _Allgemeine Zeitung_ is \"the best\\nMunich paper,\" and it is the one I had in my mind when I was describing\\na \"first-class German daily\" above. The entire paper, opened out, is not\\nquite as large as a single page of the New York _Herald_. It is printed\\non both sides, of course; but in such large type that its entire\\ncontents could be put, in _Herald_ type, upon a single page of the\\n_Herald_--and there would still be room enough on the page for the\\n_Zeitung_\\'s \"supplement\" and some portion of the _Zeitung_\\'s next day\\'s\\ncontents.\\n\\nSuch is the first-class daily. The dailies actually printed in Munich\\nare all called second-class by the public. If you ask which is the best\\nof these second-class papers they say there is no difference; one is as\\ngood as another. I have preserved a copy of one of them; it is called\\nthe _Mnchener Tages-Anzeiger_, and bears date January 25, 1879.\\nComparisons are odious, but they need not be malicious; and without any\\nmalice I wish to compare this journal, published in a German city of\\n170,000 inhabitants, with journals of other countries. I know of no\\nother way to enable the reader to \"size\" the thing.\\n\\nA column of an average daily paper in America contains from 1,800 to\\n2,500 words; the reading-matter in a single issue consists of from\\n25,000 to 50,000 words. The reading-matter in my copy of the Munich\\njournal consists of a total of 1,654 words --for I counted them. That\\nwould be nearly a column of one of our dailies. A single issue of\\nthe bulkiest daily newspaper in the world--the London _Times_--often\\ncontains 100,000 words of reading-matter. Considering that the _Daily\\nAnzeiger_ issues the usual twenty-six numbers per month, the reading\\nmatter in a single number of the London _Times_ would keep it in \"copy\"\\ntwo months and a half.\\n\\nThe _Anzeiger_ is an eight-page paper; its page is one inch wider and\\none inch longer than a foolscap page; that is to say, the dimensions of\\nits page are somewhere between those of a schoolboy\\'s slate and a lady\\'s\\npocket handkerchief. One-fourth of the first page is taken up with the\\nheading of the journal; this gives it a rather top-heavy appearance;\\nthe rest of the first page is reading-matter; all of the second page is\\nreading-matter; the other six pages are devoted to advertisements.\\n\\nThe reading-matter is compressed into two hundred and five small-pica\\nlines, and is lighted up with eight pica headlines. The bill of fare\\nis as follows: First, under a pica headline, to enforce attention and\\nrespect, is a four-line sermon urging mankind to remember that, although\\nthey are pilgrims here below, they are yet heirs of heaven; and that\\n\"When they depart from earth they soar to heaven.\" Perhaps a four-line\\nsermon in a Saturday paper is the sufficient German equivalent of the\\neight or ten columns of sermons which the New-Yorkers get in their\\nMonday morning papers. The latest news (two days old) follows the\\nfour-line sermon, under the pica headline \"Telegrams\"--these are\\n\"telegraphed\" with a pair of scissors out of the _Augsburger Zeitung_ of\\nthe day before. These telegrams consist of fourteen and two-thirds lines\\nfrom Berlin, fifteen lines from Vienna, and two and five-eights lines\\nfrom Calcutta. Thirty-three small-pica lines of telegraphic news in a\\ndaily journal in a King\\'s Capital of one hundred and seventy thousand\\ninhabitants is surely not an overdose. Next we have the pica heading,\\n\"News of the Day,\" under which the following facts are set forth: Prince\\nLeopold is going on a visit to Vienna, six lines; Prince Arnulph is\\ncoming back from Russia, two lines; the Landtag will meet at ten o\\'clock\\nin the morning and consider an election law, three lines and one word\\nover; a city government item, five and one-half lines; prices of tickets\\nto the proposed grand Charity Ball, twenty-three lines--for this one\\nitem occupies almost one-fourth of the entire first page; there is to be\\na wonderful Wagner concert in Frankfurt-on-the-Main, with an orchestra\\nof one hundred and eight instruments, seven and one-half lines. That\\nconcludes the first page. Eighty-five lines, altogether, on that page,\\nincluding three headlines. About fifty of those lines, as one perceives,\\ndeal with local matters; so the reporters are not overworked.\\n\\nExactly one-half of the second page is occupied with an opera criticism,\\nfifty-three lines (three of them being headlines), and \"Death Notices,\"\\nten lines.\\n\\nThe other half of the second page is made up of two paragraphs under\\nthe head of \"Miscellaneous News.\" One of these paragraphs tells about a\\nquarrel between the Czar of Russia and his eldest son, twenty-one and\\na half lines; and the other tells about the atrocious destruction of a\\npeasant child by its parents, forty lines, or one-fifth of the total of\\nthe reading-matter contained in the paper.\\n\\nConsider what a fifth part of the reading-matter of an American daily\\npaper issued in a city of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants\\namounts to! Think what a mass it is. Would any one suppose I could so\\nsnugly tuck away such a mass in a chapter of this book that it would be\\ndifficult to find it again if the reader lost his place? Surely not.\\nI will translate that child-murder word for word, to give the reader a\\nrealizing sense of what a fifth part of the reading-matter of a Munich\\ndaily actually is when it comes under measurement of the eye:\\n\\n\"From Oberkreuzberg, January 21st, the _Donau Zeitung_ receives a long\\naccount of a crime, which we shortened as follows: In Rametuach,\\na village near Eppenschlag, lived a young married couple with two\\nchildren, one of which, a boy aged five, was born three years before the\\nmarriage. For this reason, and also because a relative at Iggensbach had\\nbequeathed M400 ($100) to the boy, the heartless father considered him\\nin the way; so the unnatural parents determined to sacrifice him in the\\ncruelest possible manner. They proceeded to starve him slowly to death,\\nmeantime frightfully maltreating him--as the village people now make\\nknown, when it is too late. The boy was shut in a hole, and when\\npeople passed by he cried, and implored them to give him bread. His\\nlong-continued tortures and deprivations destroyed him at last, on the\\nthird of January. The sudden (sic) death of the child created suspicion,\\nthe more so as the body was immediately clothed and laid upon the bier.\\nTherefore the coroner gave notice, and an inquest was held on the 6th.\\nWhat a pitiful spectacle was disclosed then! The body was a complete\\nskeleton. The stomach and intestines were utterly empty; they contained\\nnothing whatsoever. The flesh on the corpse was not as thick as the back\\nof a knife, and incisions in it brought not one drop of blood. There\\nwas not a piece of sound skin the size of a dollar on the whole body;\\nwounds, scars, bruises, discolored extravasated blood, everywhere--even\\non the soles of the feet there were wounds. The cruel parents asserted\\nthat the boy had been so bad that they had been obliged to use severe\\npunishments, and that he finally fell over a bench and broke his neck.\\nHowever, they were arrested two weeks after the inquest and put in the\\nprison at Deggendorf.\"\\n\\nYes, they were arrested \"two weeks after the inquest.\" What a home sound\\nthat has. That kind of police briskness rather more reminds me of my\\nnative land than German journalism does.\\n\\nI think a German daily journal doesn\\'t do any good to speak of, but at\\nthe same time it doesn\\'t do any harm. That is a very large merit, and\\nshould not be lightly weighted nor lightly thought of.\\n\\nThe German humorous papers are beautifully printed upon fine paper, and\\nthe illustrations are finely drawn, finely engraved, and are not vapidly\\nfunny, but deliciously so. So also, generally speaking, are the two or\\nthree terse sentences which accompany the pictures. I remember one of\\nthese pictures: A most dilapidated tramp is ruefully contemplating some\\ncoins which lie in his open palm. He says: \"Well, begging is getting\\nplayed out. Only about five marks ($1.25) for the whole day; many an\\nofficial makes more!\" And I call to mind a picture of a commercial\\ntraveler who is about to unroll his samples:\\n\\nMERCHANT (pettishly).--_No_, don\\'t. I don\\'t want to buy anything!\\n\\nDRUMMER.--If you please, I was only going to show you--\\n\\nMERCHANT.--But I don\\'t wish to see them!\\n\\nDRUMMER (after a pause, pleadingly).--But do you you mind letting _me_\\nlook at them! I haven\\'t seen them for three weeks!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Tramp Abroad, Complete, by Mark\\nTwain (Samuel Clemens)\\n\\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK HUCKLEBERRY FINN ***\\n\\n***** This file should be named 119-h.txt or 119-h.zip ***** This\\nand all associated files of various formats will be found in:\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/1/1/119\\n\\nProduced by David Widger.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing\\nthe number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array\\nof equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\\nthe IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\nvisit http://pglaf.org\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\\na copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n\\n\\n'"
